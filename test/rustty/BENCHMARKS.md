# Portable terminal primitive benchmarks

The Rustty benchmarks use Criterion and call the headless `rustty-vt` APIs
directly. They do not construct a session, PTY, font system, renderer, GPU, or
window. Criterion is a development dependency only. No application build is
needed. Timing excludes terminal construction and input generation; the `feed`
and `stream` workloads include UTF-8 decoding and VT parsing.

The latest [complete Ghostty comparison](#core-checkpoint-after-step-39)
covers all 54 workloads with the current core, including the scalar-scan
controls and remaining gaps. Each table identifies its measured source;
stage ratios are not multiplied.
The [step 39 renderer comparison](#step-39-reuse-the-empty-tail-boundary-for-painting)
measures preparation at standard and Retina sizes;
[step 40](#step-40-reuse-exact-srgb-channel-conversions) removes repeated color conversions,
[step 41](#step-41-reuse-row-and-shaping-scratch) reuses row and shaping buffers,
and [step 42](#step-42-assign-fallback-glyph-anchors-during-emission) removes a glyph pass. The
[step 38 parity comparison](#step-38-execute-the-differential-runner-in-rust)
measures the Rust runner with preserved fixture data.
The [step 35 renderer comparison](#step-35-index-glyph-anchors-directly-during-frame-preparation)
uses the supplied scrolling profile to remove per-run glyph-anchor hashing.
The [step 36 GPU comparison](#step-36-submit-terminal-rectangles-as-gpu-instances)
measures instanced rectangle uploads and analyzes the static-looking Codex trace.

```sh
cargo bench --offline -p rustty-vt --bench primitives
# Filter a single primitive and corpus:
cargo bench --offline -p rustty-vt --bench primitives -- rustty/print/chinese
# Exercise every workload once, without collecting timing statistics:
cargo bench --offline -p rustty-vt --bench primitives -- --test
```

## Before and after

Keep the harness, input, compiler flags, and machine the same across revisions.
Build both revisions before measuring, then run them **serially** with other
builds and benchmarks stopped. Criterion supplies warmup, sampling, confidence
intervals, outlier analysis, and saved baseline comparisons.

```sh
cargo bench --offline -p rustty-vt --bench primitives -- --save-baseline before
# After the implementation change:
cargo bench --offline -p rustty-vt --bench primitives -- --baseline before
```

Set `CRITERION_HOME` to the same absolute directory when using separate
worktrees or target directories. Results otherwise live in `target/criterion`.
For an exploratory run, append `--sample-size 20 --warm-up-time 0.3
--measurement-time 1`; use the defaults for longer measurements.

To measure the earlier String-backed cells, copy this same benchmark to that
revision and adapt only `cell_sum` to read `row.cells[col].text`, and `scalar`
to read `cell.text.chars().next()`. All setup and measured operations stay the
same. The benchmark prints the compiled cell size to identify its layout.

## Ghostty comparison

The optional Zig executable imports only `libghostty-vt` and the Zig standard
library. It avoids the application dependencies and macOS instrumentation in
the general `ghostty-bench` runner. This target also cross-compiles to Linux.

```sh
zig build vt-primitives test-vt-primitives \
  -Demit-lib-vt=true -Demit-macos-app=false -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
GHOSTTY_PRIMITIVES_BIN="$PWD/zig-out/bin/vt-primitives" \
  cargo bench --offline -p rustty-vt --bench primitives
```

With that environment variable, Criterion registers matching `ghostty/*`
groups. `iter_custom` returns the duration reported by the **native operation
loop**; process startup, file reads, terminal setup, JSON, IPC, and final
terminal destruction are excluded. Predecoding for the original primitives is
also excluded; `feed` and `stream` decode inside their measured parser calls. Both engines use identical
pre-generated UTF-8 corpora and validate content checksums. Ghostty's own unit
check additionally inspects combining and ZWJ suffixes and cloned text.
The native process primes a fresh terminal for each Criterion batch; Rust
retains its primed terminal across batches. Each batch repeats its operation
many times to measure steady behavior.

For a Rust-only saved baseline, filter the comparison to `rustty`, then run
the `ghostty` groups separately: Criterion's strict `--baseline` requires an
existing baseline for every selected group. Compare the resulting Criterion
estimates using the same units. Native pages, allocators, and retained metadata
differ between engines, so these are comparisons of equivalent terminal
operations, not of Rust versus Zig in isolation.

## Workloads and units

All terminals have 128 columns and 32 rows and DEC 2027 grapheme handling
enabled. The six original primitives and `feed` disable scrollback. Their
corpora repeat a fixed pattern 128 times:

| Corpus | Pattern | Input scalars | Allocating text path |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| ASCII | `abcdefgh` | 1,024 | None with inline cells |
| Chinese | `天地玄黄宇宙洪荒` | 1,024 | None: each ideograph is one inline scalar |
| Combining | `áb̂c̃d̈` | 1,024 | 512 two-scalar graphemes |
| Emoji | `👩‍💻👨‍🚀` | 768 | 256 three-scalar ZWJ graphemes |

| Primitive | Measured work | Throughput unit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `width` | Unicode width lookup on predecoded scalars | Input scalar |
| `print` | Home cursor and overwrite the same populated viewport via `Terminal::print` | Input scalar |
| `scalar` | Sum the first codepoint of every active cell | Cell slot (4,096 per scan) |
| `read` | Sum every codepoint, including page-owned grapheme suffixes | Cell slot (4,096 per scan) |
| `clone` | Copy the visible screen and destroy the copy | Cell slot (4,096 per copy) |
| `reflow` | Resize 128 → 64 → 128 columns, preserving all text | Complete resize round trip |
| `feed` | Parse CUP (home cursor) followed by the same UTF-8 text as `print` | Input byte |
| `stream` | Parse 32 plain wrapped records, scrolling and evicting bounded history | Input byte |
| `stream_styled` | Same records with alternating SGR foreground colors and bold | Input byte |

`print` measures warmed overwrites, including replacement of previous text;
it bypasses the UTF-8/VT parser. `scalar` isolates inline access, whereas `read`
uses the public text iterator, decoding UTF-8 only for graphemes. Empty cells and
wide-cell continuations are scanned too. `clone` includes destruction in both
engines. Reflow fits within the active screen even for the Chinese corpus.

`feed` exposes UTF-8 decoding, parser dispatch, and any printable-run batching in
addition to cell replacement. It includes a three-byte CUP sequence. Stream
iterations contain 32 records of 192 display columns followed by CRLF: 6,144
printed columns and 64 physical rows. Record lengths are equal in display
columns across corpora, using 24 ASCII, 12 Chinese, or 48 combining/emoji pattern
repetitions. `stream_styled` cycles palette colors 1–4, alternates bold, and
resets SGR before each CRLF.

| Stream corpus | Printable scalars per iteration | Plain input bytes | Styled input bytes |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| ASCII | 6,144 | 6,208 | 6,576 |
| Chinese | 3,072 | 9,280 | 9,648 |
| Combining | 12,288 | 18,496 | 18,864 |
| Emoji | 9,216 | 33,856 | 34,224 |

Both stream engines request a 1,024-line history limit with no byte limit and
prime with 2,048 physical rows before measurement, so allocations and history
eviction are already active. Native pages and resource admission can retain
different exact row counts below the same requested limit. Rust keeps the
terminal across Criterion batches; the native helper primes a fresh terminal
for each batch. History eviction is page-granular, so longer measurements
average over allocation/recycling phases better than single iterations.

Outside the timers, the harness checks the analytically expected visible text,
every populated cell's foreground/bold, final cursor, and bounded nonempty
history. An order-sensitive checksum over active cell contents and styles must
match the native helper. These checks are exercised by `--test` as well as
ordinary Criterion runs. All input generation and priming stay outside timing.

Allocator instrumentation is excluded from timing. The separate
`scalar_allocations` test checks that ordinary scalar printing and reads make
no allocations. Chinese text alone does not exercise the grapheme allocator;
the combining and emoji cases do.

### Supplemental chunked input

The six Rust-only `rustty/chunked_feed_mixed` and
`rustty/chunked_stream_mixed` cases deliver identical input whole, in 7-byte
chunks, or in 4-KiB chunks. Chunk boundaries may split UTF-8, CSI, combining
sequences and ZWJ emoji. Each 16-column unit is `abcdefgh天地áb̂👩‍💻`, with
foreground/bold SGR changes between units, exposing short printable runs.

The feed case overwrites 16 populated rows with 128 units (4,935 input bytes),
including CUP and a final SGR reset, without scrollback. The stream case uses
the same 32 wrapped 192-column records, 1,024-line history limit and 2,048-row
priming as the original streams (14,976 input bytes per iteration). Throughput
counts input bytes. Construction, input generation, priming and validation
remain outside timing; each timed iteration includes all chunk deliveries.

Before timing, all three deliveries must produce identical cursor, history,
cell text, widths, styles and wrap flags. Exact expected cells and row layout
are also checked independently before and after timing, including retained
history. These groups leave the original 36 workloads and native helper
unchanged. Save a separate baseline for them:

```sh
cargo bench --offline -p rustty-vt --bench primitives -- \
  chunked_ --save-baseline chunked-before
```

### Supplemental history reflow

The four Rust-only `rustty/reflow_history` cases use the same ASCII, Chinese,
combining and emoji stream records. Setup writes 256 records of 192 display
columns plus CRLF, retaining 481 history rows and 32 visible rows at 128
columns. Each timed iteration resizes 128 → 64 → 128 columns. At 64 columns,
737 history rows remain; the 1,024-line limit and absent byte limit allow all
content to survive. Throughput counts complete resize round trips.

One full resize round trip primes the terminal before timing. No input is
added inside the measured loop, so history neither grows nor evicts records.
Outside timing, exact cell text, widths, styles, wrap flags, cursor position
and history/viewport row counts are checked at both widths before measurement
and at 128 columns after measurement. Construction, parsing, priming and
validation are excluded. These cases supplement the existing 42 Rust workloads
and have no native counterpart.

### Supplemental host-memory policy

The eight Rust-only `rustty/stream_memory_capped` and
`rustty/stream_styled_memory_capped` cases repeat the original stream inputs
with a 50,000,000-byte owned-history cap, matching the app's default host-memory
policy. They retain the original 1,024-line native limit and priming. The host
cap is high enough to preserve this workload's history, but activates its
page-capacity accounting (incremental row/payload accounting in older revisions). These cases exercise that accounting cost;
they do not measure host-cap eviction or the complete app.

Outside timing, the harness checks that enabling the cap and feeding another
batch preserve the uncapped reference's history length and expected visible
contents, styles and cursor. The same content and history bounds, plus the
owned-byte cap, are checked after timing. The existing 46 Rust workloads and
36 native comparisons are unchanged; the new eight cases have no native
counterpart because this cap charges Rust-owned storage.

## Optimization measurements, 2026-09-15

The table compares Rustty at `3116bbb` with the four optimizations ending at
`2880a22`. Both versions have 56-byte cells. Ghostty production code is unchanged;
the reference uses the original native benchmark binary. These are medians in
microseconds per workload, with the units defined above, on an Apple M4 Max
running macOS 26.7, Rust 1.98.1, Zig 0.16.0, and Criterion 0.8.2. Rust uses the
workspace release profile (thin LTO, one codegen unit); Ghostty uses ReleaseFast.
Runs were serial, without competing builds or tests, using 20 samples, 0.3 seconds
of warmup, and 1 second of measurement per case. These short samples measure
the primitives, not application CPU or rendering performance.

| reflow | Chinese | 270.201 | 74.211 | 26.377 |
| reflow | Combining | 297.831 | 64.418 | 51.870 |
| reflow | Emoji | 275.598 | 56.242 | 32.131 |

Ghostty's indexed Unicode tables and tracked pins informed the Rustty changes:
Unicode properties now use deduplicated blocks instead of binary searches,
and reflow maps only live anchors instead of every cell. Inline text iteration
avoids a scalar-to-UTF-8 round trip. Grapheme payloads use page chunk indices
instead of hashing, and append builds its replacement in bounded stack scratch
before allocating one shared payload.

Full-text reads improve 4.5–7.1×, reflow 3.6–4.9×, Chinese printing 2.0×, and
combining/emoji printing 2.0–2.6×. ASCII printing remains essentially unchanged
and substantially slower than Ghostty. A separate scalar-scan confirmation
using 50 samples, 0.5 seconds of warmup, and 2 seconds of measurement confirmed
small regressions: Chinese 1.485 → 1.535 µs (3.4%) and emoji 1.473 → 1.530 µs
(3.9%) per 4,096-cell scan. No scalar-scan speedup is claimed.

The indexed Unicode table occupies
55,808 shared read-only bytes, replacing 14,994 bytes of production range data;
the old ranges remain a test-only oracle. Grapheme slot metadata is allocated
lazily: scalar-only pages have none, while long or sparse suffix allocations
can leave empty slots in the indexed vector. This change does not shrink cells.

The Ghostty combining-print result hits its existing full grapheme-map cliff
at 512 clusters. It does not represent general combining-text throughput:
the earlier density control measured about 404 µs at 512 clusters and 10 µs
at 513, where priming triggers page growth. Ghostty production code was not
modified to remove this cliff. Native reflow also includes OS page-recycling
costs, so the comparison is specific to this machine and allocator.

Validation passed all 291 `rustty-vt` tests, all 24 benchmark smoke cases, strict
all-target VT Clippy, formatting, the app check, and native benchmark unit
checks. Differential Unicode, snapshot, resize, graphics-anchor, and grapheme
suites passed 7,970 of 7,973 comparisons. The remaining three are chunking
variants of the preexisting `pages/graphemes/wrap/3/1/1/alternate` discrepancy:
Rustty preserves a ZWJ when wrapping a widening grapheme in a one-row alternate
screen; Ghostty drops it. This also reproduces before the inline-cell changes.

## Printing and scrolling follow-up, 2026-09-15

This follow-up starts with the already optimized production code at `e112c2c`.
The identical 36-case harness from `847ad1c` measures that baseline and the
production changes ending at `d2911c9` (`5cc935a` replaces printed cells directly;
`d2911c9` avoids building resource lists for rows without resources). Ghostty
production code remains unchanged; only its benchmark utility was extended.

Measurements use the same machine, compilers, release settings, and short
Criterion sampling configuration described above. All builds and tests finished
before serial timing. Values are medians in microseconds per complete workload.
The `feed` and stream byte/scalar counts are defined in the workload tables;
they are not the same amount of work as the original `print` case.

ASCII printing improves 3.38× and Chinese printing 1.87×. Parsed ASCII overwrites
improve 2.73×, plain ASCII streams 2.66×, and styled ASCII streams 2.18×. This
pass does not reach the proposed 5× printing target. Ghostty's printable-run
batching remains a substantial opportunity for parsed output. Cell size stays
56 bytes. The ASCII/combining direct scalar-scan controls are about 3% slower
in this run, roughly 0.04 microseconds per 4,096-cell scan; those regressions
are retained in the table rather than treated as improvements.

Sampling used optimized Rust binaries with debug information and frame pointers,
at nominal 1 kHz for eight seconds per workload. Timings above use the normal
release binaries without profiling. Shares below describe physical symbols;
inlined work contributes to its enclosing symbol, and shares are independently
normalized for each run.

- Before the change, cursor/style/link helpers account for about 32% of ASCII
  printing samples, and erase-before-replace accounts for another 10%.
- After replacement was consolidated, `sync_resource_row` accounted for 29% of
  ASCII stream samples. After skipping resource-list construction for rows
  without resources, its share falls to 6.4%.
- Final ASCII streaming spends about 28% in cell writing, 16% in the enclosing
  print operation, 11% accounting for row storage, and 8% allocating/initializing
  cell rows. These identify remaining costs beyond printable-run batching.

Two native reference cases need special interpretation. Combining overwrite
still hits the full 512-entry grapheme-map cliff. Parsed Chinese overwrite hits
another existing cliff: the native batch writer scans the remaining eligible
Unicode run, rejects an existing wide destination cell, prints one character,
and rescans the suffix. That is roughly half a million eligibility checks for
1,024 characters. A confirming profile attributes 96.4% of samples to
`Terminal.printSlice`. Fresh-row Chinese streaming batches successfully. The
Chinese `feed` result therefore does not describe general Chinese throughput.
Neither native production behavior was changed.

Final validation: all 293 `rustty-vt` tests, all 72 Rust/native benchmark smoke
cases, strict all-target Clippy, formatting, and the app check pass. Charset,
style, hyperlink, and grapheme differential suites pass 2,013 of 2,016 cases;
the three failures are the same previously documented alternate-screen ZWJ
mismatch in whole/scalar/chunked input variants. Independent review found no
correctness issues in either production change.

## Mode lookup and reflow follow-up, 2026-09-15

This pass compares the session baseline `f56b1af` with `1bc18ab`. The benchmark
harness, corpora, release profile and 56-byte cells are unchanged. Both binaries
were built before the final serial measurements, with task builds and tests
stopped. Runs use the same machine described above, macOS 26.7, Rust 1.98.1,
Criterion 0.8.2, thin LTO and one codegen unit: 20 samples, 0.3 seconds of warmup
and 1 second of measurement. Values below are medians in microseconds per
complete workload. Ghostty remains the unchanged correctness reference; its
previous timing results were not remeasured in this pass.

Printing improves 1.15–1.71× and reflow improves 1.13–1.35×. The changes are
separate commits:

- `9f8e5ba` stores current, saved and default modes in their existing snapshot
  bit order. Constant mode queries compile to a single bit extraction instead
  of searching a tree for every printed scalar. Save/reset lifetimes and
  snapshot encoding are preserved. The public serde map shape is retained for
  complete supported mode sets; incomplete or unknown-key maps are rejected.
- `ad838f6` defers cell allocation for independent blank reflow rows until they
  contain copied cells or survive trailing-row trimming. Row identities,
  anchors and metadata remain available throughout the copy. Exact capacities
  are preserved even at widths 1–3, keeping history memory accounting stable.
- `1bc18ab` walks immutable source pages in order and computes each page's
  resized capacity once, avoiding repeated page scans and layout arithmetic.

An eight-second, nominal 1 kHz profile of baseline ASCII reflow attributed about
25% of active samples to cell-vector initialization and 11% to page layout,
metadata and column adjustment. These are physical-symbol shares from an
optimized build with debug information and frame pointers; inlined work is
charged to its enclosing symbol. The timing table uses normal release builds.

Parsed input and streaming medians also improve. Short-run means for some
stream and clone cases have large outliers, so those median changes should not
be read as precise application-throughput predictions. Scalar/read/clone
controls include small regressions in the table; no speedup is claimed for
those paths.

A longer control confirmation used 50 samples, 0.5 seconds of warmup and
2 seconds of measurement, again running the same binaries serially. Combining
clone measured 13.204 → 13.186 µs (no significant change), and emoji clone
12.138 → 11.938 µs. The combining scalar scan measured 1.664 → 1.582 µs,
so its short-run regression did not repeat. Combining full-text reads did
confirm a small regression: 2.493 → 2.535 µs, or 1.7% per 4,096-cell scan.

Validation passed all 288 VT tests, strict all-target VT Clippy, formatting,
the app check and all 72 Rust/native benchmark smoke cases. The selected mode,
snapshot, resize and reflow differential suites passed all 2,515 comparisons.
Review checked mode save/reset behavior, snapshot bit order, page alignment,
resource rebuilding and anchor preservation. The new regression checks retained
blank gaps, viewport padding, snapshot round trips, subsequent printing and
exact capacities at widths 1–3.

## Pre-batching Rustty/Ghostty baseline, 2026-09-15

Fresh measurements at `71a0b4f` (Rustty production code through `1bc18ab`),
using the unchanged 36-case harness for both engines. Both binaries were built
and all 72 smoke cases passed before timing; the native benchmark unit checks
also passed. All 72 measured cases completed their content validations.

Runs were serial, with task builds and tests stopped, on the same Apple M4 Max
running macOS 26.7, Rust 1.98.1, Zig 0.16.0 and Criterion 0.8.2. Rust uses thin
LTO and one codegen unit; Ghostty uses ReleaseFast. Each case uses 50 samples,
0.5 seconds of warmup and 2 seconds of measurement. These longer samples
establish a new baseline; differences from earlier tables are not additional
optimization gains.

Values are median microseconds per complete workload, including a complete
resize round trip for reflow. **Rustty/Ghostty** divides the two medians:
values above 1 mean Ghostty is faster; values below 1 mean Rustty is faster.

Combining `print`/`feed` still encounter Ghostty's 512-cluster grapheme-map
cliff, and Chinese `feed` still encounters its wide-destination suffix-rescan
cliff. These cases do not describe general native Unicode throughput. Reflow
still excludes scrollback; stream cases use the requested 1,024-line history
limit. Native batches construct a fresh primed terminal while Rust retains its
primed terminal, with setup excluded from both timers.

Some native feed/stream medians remain variable. For example, the 95% median
confidence intervals are 8.387–9.433 µs for ASCII `stream` and
493.845–600.944 µs for combining `feed`. The saved estimates and samples retain
all confidence intervals for subsequent comparisons.

The local Criterion baseline is **`baseline-71a0b4f`**, under
`target/criterion-baseline-71a0b4f/`. That directory also retains the benchmark
binaries, SHA-256 hashes and toolchain metadata in `metadata.json`, the run and
smoke logs, and the extracted `comparison.json`/`comparison.md` table.
After building a candidate, compare it with this baseline using:

```sh
CRITERION_HOME="$PWD/target/criterion-baseline-71a0b4f" \
GHOSTTY_PRIMITIVES_BIN="$PWD/target/criterion-baseline-71a0b4f/vt-primitives" \
  cargo bench --offline -p rustty-vt --bench primitives -- \
  '^(rustty|ghostty)/(print|reflow|feed|stream|stream_styled|scalar|read|clone|width)/' \
  --baseline baseline-71a0b4f \
  --sample-size 50 --warm-up-time 0.5 --measurement-time 2
```

## Parsed input and streaming batches, 2026-09-15

This pass compares production code at `c98fa109c`, built with the 42-case
harness from `329efa7`, against `d43d848` using that same harness. The original
36 workloads are unchanged; the six mixed/chunked workloads described above
are Rust-only. Both Rust binaries were built before measurement. Runs were
serial, without concurrent builds or tests, using 50 samples, 0.5 seconds of
warmup and 2 seconds of measurement on the same machine and release settings
documented above. Values are median microseconds per complete workload.
Speedup is Rustty before/after; Rustty/Ghostty is Rustty after/native, so values
above 1 in the last column mean Ghostty is faster. The Ghostty column is a
fresh measurement of the unchanged native binary. Its feed/stream timings
remain variable; differences from the preceding native table are not code gains.

ASCII `feed` improves 10.01×; plain and styled ASCII streams improve 2.73× and
3.24×. Chinese improves 2.17× for `feed`, 1.61× for plain streams and 1.86× for
styled streams. Mixed/chunked feed improves 1.22–1.36× and mixed streams
1.28–1.45×. Emoji streaming is effectively unchanged. The remaining plain
ASCII/Chinese stream gap is still about 9× versus this native reference.

The parser now delivers borrowed ASCII and valid UTF-8 runs to the terminal.
Eligible spans share cursor, page and style work across multiple cells.
Scalar printing still handles wrapping, grapheme joins and complex destination
cells. Insert mode, disabled autowrap, legacy character mappings and hyperlinks
retain scalar handling; UTF-8 batching also falls back for horizontal margins.
Both `feed` and `feed_with_handler` preserve input order and chunk continuation.

Three shared changes reduce scrolling costs: blank rows initialize cells
directly instead of cloning their resource-bearing type; row accounting adds
only present payloads and creates a hyperlink deduplication set only when
needed; resource-page lookup searches from the active end of history. Cell
size remains 56 bytes, and owned-history charges retain their previous
saturating arithmetic and sharing rules. Ghostty production code is unchanged.

The full run records 8–13% slower direct printing and smaller regressions in
several scan/read controls. A second 50-sample run measured the final binary
first, then the before binary, with the same settings. The larger Unicode-print
slowdowns did not repeat; ASCII printing and combining reads remained about 4%
slower. The complete first-run table is retained above, and the reverse-order
controls below show the timing sensitivity. No scan/read speedup is claimed.
Positive changes here mean the final binary is slower.

Adding the Unicode run writer made LLVM outline the shared grapheme check;
keeping that check inline reduced the resulting Chinese-print slowdown.
Future comparisons should retain the complete harness as well as the
production revision, compiler and release settings: adding benchmarks can
also change generated code in unchanged operations.

Validation passed 294 VT tests, 12 parser tests and all 78 Rust/native benchmark
smoke cases. The scalar-reference table covers 2,088 delivery variants across
Unicode, terminal modes, margins, overwrites and host-handler paths, with
additional checks for ignored scalars after public cursor edits, effect order
and snapshot continuation. Native differential testing passed 6,966 of 6,969
comparisons. The three failures are the previously documented whole/scalar/
chunked variants of `pages/graphemes/wrap/3/1/1/alternate`: Rustty preserves a
ZWJ that Ghostty drops when a widening grapheme wraps in a one-row alternate
screen. Strict parser/VT Clippy, formatting and the app check also passed.

The local results are in `target/criterion-batching/`: `comparison.json` and
`comparison.md` contain the table; `metadata.json` identifies revisions,
toolchains, binary SHA-256 hashes and validation logs. Rust estimates use the
`matched-before` and `final` labels, from `matched-before.log` and
`matched-after.log`. Native `final` estimates come from the earlier `final.log`
run. `reverse-controls.json`/`reverse-controls.md` retain the confirmation
table. The final profiling captures and summaries are under `profiles/`.

To repeat the Rust comparison with the retained executables, keep builds and
other benchmarks stopped during both runs. The fresh directory below avoids
replacing the recorded results. Build any new candidate before either run and
retain this same 42-case harness:

```sh
CRITERION_HOME="$PWD/target/criterion-batching-repeat" \
  target/criterion-batching/primitives-before --bench '^rustty/' \
  --save-baseline matched-before \
  --sample-size 50 --warm-up-time 0.5 --measurement-time 2
CRITERION_HOME="$PWD/target/criterion-batching-repeat" \
  target/criterion-batching/primitives-final --bench '^rustty/' \
  --baseline matched-before \
  --sample-size 50 --warm-up-time 0.5 --measurement-time 2
```

Final eight-second, nominal 1 kHz profiles used an optimized Rust build with
debug information and frame pointers. ASCII streaming spent 20% of active
samples in `sync_resource_row`, 17% in `scroll_up` (including inlined blank-row
initialization), 17% in `Row::storage_bytes`, and 11% in `print_ascii`. Chinese
streaming spent 31% in `print_utf8`, 15% in row synchronization, 12% in scrolling
and 11% in storage accounting. These are physical-symbol shares, including
inlined work. Row synchronization also scans fresh blank cells; its full cost
is not page lookup. Row lifecycle/accounting and layout calculations therefore
remain candidates for the next plain-stream pass.

The native combining overwrite and Chinese `feed` cliffs still limit those
comparisons. Use bounded `stream` and `stream_styled` results to assess ongoing
output, and the mixed/chunked cases to check fallback and delivery overhead.
Combining and ZWJ-heavy input still needs scalar grapheme work. The reflow
workload remains limited to the active screen; history reflow needs separate
workloads before choosing its next optimization.

## Scrolling follow-up and history reflow, 2026-09-15

This pass compares production code at `1c09810` with `00c1116`, using the same
46-case Rust harness from `263f4c4` for both. The original 42 workloads are
unchanged; four new history-reflow cases retain 256 records across each resize
round trip. The native helper and Ghostty production code are unchanged.

Both Rust binaries were built before the final consecutive before/after runs.
Native measurements then used the retained ReleaseFast helper. All timings
were serial, with builds, tests and profiles stopped, on the Apple M4 Max and
toolchain/release settings documented above: 50 samples, 0.5 seconds of warmup
and 2 seconds of measurement. Values are median microseconds per complete
workload. Speedup is Rustty before/after; Rustty/Ghostty is Rustty after/native.
Native timing changes from earlier tables are not production code gains.
Against this reference, Rustty still takes about 8× as long for plain
ASCII/Chinese streams.

Plain ASCII streaming improves 1.30× and styled ASCII streaming 1.26×;
Chinese improves 1.14× and 1.17× respectively. Combining and emoji stream
medians improve only about 1–2%. Mixed streams improve 1.05–1.06×, and the
active-screen reflow round trips improve 1.03–1.18×. History reflow is essentially
unchanged: these new cases establish a baseline for subsequent scrollback work.

The implementation changes are separate commits:

- `0c88873` assigns the known fresh blank row's resource page directly after
  growth/eviction. Existing rows retain ordinary resource transfer, including
  externally supplied hyperlink payloads and page-boundary moves.
- `6794e3e` delays minimum-limit/layout calculations while a row fits existing
  page capacity and the raw line limit is not exceeded. Byte-floor work runs
  only when a byte policy exists. Native floors and recycling order remain
  unchanged, without cached policy state.
- `00c1116` checks active physical row widths once on the ordinary index-scroll
  path. Its two independent mutation paths retain their own widening checks.

Intermediate 30-sample measurements supported each change. The initial
column-scan measurement was slower; a repeated paired run with the same
binaries improved plain ASCII/Chinese streams about 3%. The final table uses
fresh consecutive measurements of the complete before and final binaries.

The scan/read/clone/width and direct-print controls range from 0.4% faster to
3.4% slower in this run. Those small regressions remain in the table; no
control-path speedup is claimed.

All 296 VT tests, strict all-target VT Clippy, formatting, the app check and
all 82 Rust/native benchmark smoke cases passed. The new regression checks
cover fresh-row resource ownership and native line/byte floors. Existing
snapshot/row-shift tests verify narrow restored pages, margins and pins.
Native page/layout and snapshot suites passed 6,582 of 6,585 comparisons.
The three failures remain the whole/scalar/chunked variants of
`pages/graphemes/wrap/3/1/1/alternate`: Rustty preserves the same extra ZWJ.

Final eight-second, nominal 1 kHz profiles used an optimized build with debug
information and frame pointers. Page layout/metadata symbols account for less
than 0.1% of active samples. Remaining ASCII streaming costs include
`scroll_up` at 21% (including inlined blank-row initialization),
`Row::storage_bytes` at 21%, and `sync_resource_row` at 16%. Chinese streaming
spends 37% in `print_utf8`, 13% in scrolling, 13% in storage accounting and 11%
in row synchronization. These are independently normalized physical-symbol
shares; inlined work belongs to its enclosing symbol. Row initialization,
accounting and existing-row synchronization remain the main ASCII targets.

The local artifacts are in `target/criterion-scrolling/`: `comparison.json`
and `comparison.md` contain all 46 rows; `metadata.json` records revisions,
toolchains, SHA-256 hashes and logs. Final Rust estimates use `matched-before`
and `final`; native estimates use `final`. Intermediate `before`, `blank`,
`layout`, `columns` and `column-control-*` runs remain available separately.
The final profiles and summaries are in `profiles/`.

To repeat the Rust comparison with the frozen binaries:

```sh
CRITERION_HOME="$PWD/target/criterion-scrolling-repeat" \
  target/criterion-scrolling/primitives-before --bench '^rustty/' \
  --save-baseline matched-before \
  --sample-size 50 --warm-up-time 0.5 --measurement-time 2
CRITERION_HOME="$PWD/target/criterion-scrolling-repeat" \
  target/criterion-scrolling/primitives-final --bench '^rustty/' \
  --baseline matched-before \
  --sample-size 50 --warm-up-time 0.5 --measurement-time 2
```

Ghostty's combining overwrite and Chinese `feed` cliffs still limit those
ratios as measures of general Unicode throughput. The new history-reflow
workload provides a baseline for preserved scrollback, separately from the
existing active-screen round trip. Cell size remains 56 bytes.

## Row bookkeeping follow-up, 2026-09-16

This pass compares production at `dfcfb9f` with `8e1ae0c`, using the same
54-case harness from `75dc73e`. The original 46 Rust workloads are unchanged;
eight new cases enable the app-default 50 MB owned-history cap. Ghostty
production code and its retained ReleaseFast helper are unchanged.

All builds, tests and profiles finished before the consecutive Rust before,
Rust after and native measurements. The machine and toolchains remain the
Apple M4 Max, macOS 26.7, Rust 1.98.1 and Zig 0.16.0, using the release settings
above. Each case uses 50 samples, 0.5 seconds of warmup and 2 seconds of
measurement. Values below are median microseconds per complete workload;
speedup is Rustty before/after, and Rustty/Ghostty is Rustty after/native.
Changes in native timings from earlier tables are measurement variation,
not Ghostty code gains; Rustty's paired before/after is the optimization measure.

Plain ASCII streaming improves 1.55× and styled ASCII 1.41×; Chinese improves
1.27× and 1.24×. With the host cap enabled, ASCII improves 1.20× and 1.16×,
and Chinese 1.10× and 1.08×. The larger uncapped gains do not apply to the
app's default memory policy. Mixed streams improve 1.08–1.13×. Both reflow
families are essentially unchanged. Plain ASCII/Chinese streams still take
5.06×/5.98× Ghostty's time against this fresh reference.

The implementation changes are separate commits:

- `48f8103` checks resource ownership across active page ranges before running
  per-row synchronization. Ordinary history insertion preserves those owners;
  changed or unowned rows retain the existing directional transfer path.
  Cursor synchronization still runs, including resource-induced page splits.
- `8e1ae0c` stops scanning incoming and evicted payloads when no host-memory cap
  consumes the total. Uncapped `history_bytes()` and its JSON field now compute
  the total on demand, taking time proportional to retained cells. Capped
  screens keep incremental charges. Enabling a cap already recounts current
  rows, including externally replaced rows. No per-row cache was introduced.

The original feed, print, read, scalar, clone and width controls range from
2.4% faster to 3.8% slower in this paired run. These differences remain in the
table; no broad control-path speedup is claimed. Initial 30-sample measurements
supported both changes. One capped-ASCII sample after the accounting change
was slower; a 50-sample ABBA repeat was effectively unchanged at 36.1–36.8 µs.
The final table uses fresh consecutive measurements of the full pass.

All 298 VT tests, strict all-target VT Clippy, formatting, the app check and
90 Rust/native benchmark smoke cases passed. New regressions cover unowned
public hyperlinks during scrolling, page growth, payload accounting across
cap transitions, eviction and JSON restoration. Native page/layout and both
snapshot suites passed 6,582 of 6,585 comparisons, with no selected-suite
coverage gaps. The same three failures remain the whole/scalar/chunked
variants of `pages/graphemes/wrap/3/1/1/alternate`: Rustty retains an extra ZWJ.

Final eight-second, nominal 1 kHz profiles use optimized code with debug
information and frame pointers. Uncapped ASCII and Chinese streaming recorded
no active samples in `Row::storage_bytes` or `sync_resource_row`. Capped ASCII
still spends 27% in payload accounting. Remaining uncapped ASCII samples
include scrolling/blank-row initialization at 32%, printing at 22%, and
history-prefix disposal at 10%. Chinese spends 49% in `print_utf8` and 16% in
scrolling. These are independently normalized physical-symbol shares;
inlined work belongs to the enclosing symbol. Cell size remains 56 bytes.

The local artifacts are in `target/criterion-row-bookkeeping/`:
`comparison.md` and `comparison.json` contain all 54 Rust rows and 36 native
references; `metadata.json` records revisions, hashes, toolchains and logs.
Final labels are `matched-before` and `final`; intermediate labels and the
balanced capped repeat are retained separately. Frozen executables are
`primitives-before`, `primitives-sync`, `primitives-accounting`,
`primitives-final` and `vt-primitives`; final profiles and summaries are under
`profiles/`. Ghostty's Chinese-feed and combining-overwrite cliffs remain,
so those ratios are not general Unicode-throughput comparisons.

## Ordinary grapheme boundary fast exit, 2026-09-16

`4b7a41d` returns immediately for two ordinary grapheme classes after the
existing state normalization. CJK ideographs take this path; active joining
states still reset normally, and every nonordinary pair retains the original
rules. The change adds four production lines and one regression test.

This table compares `8cba1ec` with `4b7a41d`, using the unchanged 54-case Rust
harness from `75dc73e` and the same 36 native workloads. Ghostty production
code and its ReleaseFast helper are unchanged. Machine, toolchains and release
flags remain those documented above: Apple M4 Max, macOS 26.7, Rust 1.98.1,
Zig 0.16.0, thin LTO/one codegen unit for Rust, and Criterion 0.8.2.

The initial consecutive Rust runs had severe timing variation: several
baseline interquartile ranges exceeded their medians, and plain combining
streaming measured 1,039 µs instead of the repeated roughly 375–390 µs. All
initial data are retained but excluded from the table. Every Rust case was
rerun as an adjacent before/after pair, with the first version alternating
between table rows. This alternates order across workloads, not within each
workload. Each run has 50 samples, 0.5 seconds of warmup and a 2-second target
measurement. The native column retains this pass's earlier serial native run.
Builds and tests were stopped throughout timing. Medians are microseconds per
complete workload; speedup is before/after and Rustty/Ghostty is after/native.

Chinese streaming improves 1.10× plain and 1.08× styled. With the app-default
host-memory cap enabled, those gains are 1.12× and 1.07×. Chinese feed improves
1.16× and direct print 1.04×. The remaining plain Chinese-stream gap is 5.40×
against the native reference. Combining streams are essentially unchanged;
reflow gains are negligible and retained-history reflow is up to about 1.5%
slower. Non-Chinese workloads range from 4.6% faster to 2.9% slower; no broad
speedup outside Chinese workloads is claimed.

Across selected Rust runs, the median ratio of interquartile range to
sample median is 1.34%. Plain/styled Chinese streams are around 0.7–1.5%; capped
Chinese's baseline is noisier at 6.75%, so its 1.12× estimate is less precise.
Native reflow dispersion reaches 13.30%. Small control and reflow movements
remain observations rather than attributed optimization gains.

The first candidate checked ordinary classes only while the joining state was
idle, before normalization. A balanced ABBA repeat supported its Chinese gain
but showed a small combining slowdown. Moving the ordinary-pair check after
normalization preserved the gain with less fallback overhead in subsequent
measurements. Both variants remain as frozen executables and separately
labelled estimates; the table selects only the retained implementation.

All 299 VT tests, strict all-target VT Clippy, formatting, the app check and
90 Rust/native benchmark smoke cases pass. The new persistent regression
covers every state byte on ordinary pairs, plus prepend and combining
fallbacks. An independent executable compares the previous and retained
functions for all 17 generated grapheme classes paired with all 17 classes
and all 256 state bytes: all 73,984 results and outgoing states match. Since
the function's only character-derived inputs are those classes and the
property tables are unchanged, this exhaustively checks its behavior.

Artifacts are in `target/criterion-grapheme-fast-exit/`. `comparison.md` and
`comparison.json` contain the selected 54-row comparison. Rust estimates
come from `paired/`, native estimates from the root, with `matched-before`
and `final` labels. `initial-comparison.*` and the original root Rust
estimates retain the noisy consecutive run. `metadata.json` identifies all
binaries, revisions, settings, selected logs and trial variants. The exact
Rust measurement schedule is in `paired-run.py`, and `report.py` selects the
final estimates. Frozen binaries include `primitives-before`,
`primitives-fast-exit` (the first variant), `primitives-normalized`,
`primitives-final` (identical to normalized), and `vt-primitives`. The
independent checker and reference source are retained as `equivalence.rs`
and `unicode-reference.rs`.

The native column still includes the known Chinese-feed and combining-overwrite
performance cliffs. Native timing differences from earlier tables are not
code gains. Cell size remains 56 bytes; no property cache or cell-layout
change was introduced.

## Packed pages and SIMD, 2026-09-16

This comparison starts at `c366e3768` (56-byte cells), measures packed pages
with scalar run kernels at `dae3bda84`, and then explicit SIMD at `6c4096104`.
The scalar version includes the complete storage migration, page recycling,
page-owned resource access, and host accounting changes. The SIMD version adds
`wide 1.7.0` kernels; UTF-8 decoding still uses the scalar standard-library iterator.
Here “scalar” describes the source kernels; LLVM auto-vectorization and
existing parser optimizations remain enabled in all builds. Ghostty production
code and the frozen native executable are unchanged.

The machine is an Apple M4 Max with 16 CPU cores and 64 GiB RAM, running macOS
26.7. All Rust versions use Rust 1.95.0 / LLVM 22.1.2, the workspace release
profile, thin LTO, and one codegen unit. This compiler differs from the older
measurements above; compare revisions within this table. The native executable
uses Zig 0.16.0 ReleaseFast. Harness changes only adapt row, cell, and resource
access to the new Rust API; inputs, checks, units, and timer boundaries are unchanged.

Every workload runs in the order before → scalar → SIMD → native, immediately
followed by native → SIMD → scalar → before. The 18 Rust-only workloads omit
native. Each run requests **50 samples**, 0.3 seconds of warmup, and a 1-second
measurement target. All executables were built and frozen first; timing ran
serially with builds, tests, allocation probes, and differential checks finished.
Each table entry is the median of the 100 normalized samples pooled from the
two directions, in microseconds per workload. Ratios use time: above 1 means
slower, below 1 means faster. These primitive measurements do not measure app
CPU usage, shaping, or rendering.

The final implementation reduces snapshot copy time by 51–58%, ASCII feed time
by 23%, and Chinese feed time by 43%. ASCII/Chinese streams also improve,
including the 50 MB host-cap workloads. SIMD reduces ASCII feed time by about
5% and Chinese feed time by 10% relative to the packed scalar version, and
reduces Chinese stream times by roughly 3–6%.
ASCII streams show little additional SIMD benefit.

There are substantial regressions: direct `print` takes 2.28–2.53× the baseline
time, full-text `read` takes 3.92–4.65×, and mixed chunked input takes 1.86–1.97×.
Combining/emoji feeds and streams take roughly 2.1–2.5×. Active-screen reflow
regresses 6–118%; retained-history reflow is about unchanged for ASCII, 26%
slower for Chinese, and 3.24–3.36× for combining/emoji. These costs remain in
the delivered implementation. The packed layout and ordinary-run kernels do
not establish an overall application speedup.

The median Rust interquartile range divided by sample median is 1.43%, but some
styled capped grapheme runs reach 31–46%, and some first-codepoint scans reach
27%. Width controls, combining first-codepoint scans, and ASCII history reflow
change direction between the two orders; their small pooled differences are
not treated as gains. The large snapshot/feed gains and print/read/complex-text
regressions retain their direction in both orders. Direct print, read, clone,
and reflow use the same source paths in the scalar and SIMD revisions; their
inter-revision changes include code generation and run variation. The native
Chinese-feed and combining-overwrite cliffs remain visible in the fixed
reference and were already present before this migration.

### Allocations and memory pressure

[allocations.rs](allocations.rs) wraps the system allocator in a separate
executable. It records allocation calls (including reallocations), requested
bytes, and peak live requested bytes; these are not RSS or allocator bookkeeping.
Input construction, process-wide initialization, output formatting, and final
terminal destruction are outside the counts. Construction and pressure rows
include terminal creation. Write/exposure/recycling rows report changes from
an already constructed or primed terminal, so their retained/peak columns are
deltas and can be negative. Scalar and SIMD probes were compiled independently
from their frozen revisions and produced identical results; “packed” covers both.

Each pressure case feeds 4,096 records of 192 display columns plus CRLF at
128×32, with no native history limit. The linked case combines SGR, an explicit
OSC 8 link, `á`, and a wide ideograph. Uncapped cases retain all 8,161 history
rows. The recycling case primes the 1,024-line native limit and then scrolls
20,000 additional physical rows. The exposure case fills the unused capacity
of a single 80-column page, exposing 589 rows without page growth.

The live cell is 8 bytes versus 56 bytes before. Measured uncapped ASCII heap
retention falls from 59,211,711 to 8,906,767 bytes (85%); linked/grapheme retention
falls from 71,790,767 to 32,388,863 bytes (55%). Ordinary writes remain allocation
free. Exposing existing page capacity drops from 598 allocations to zero, and
20,000-row recycling drops from 20,216 to 486 allocation calls (97.6%), with
zero retained-heap growth and at most four live pages in the probe. Recycling
still allocates small eviction/identity bookkeeping; it is bounded, not wholly
allocation free.

Preallocation increases empty 128×32 terminal retention from 234,975 to 390,735
bytes (66%). Under a 512 KiB host cap, the packed ASCII case retains 741 history
rows versus 72 before, and the linked case retains 370 versus 64. Whole-page
pruning preserves every page containing active rows, including unused capacity
and history on those pages. Thus total live memory can exceed the configured
history cap: the packed 512 KiB ASCII case retains 1,163,087 bytes and the linked
case 1,944,879 bytes. Their reclaimable `history_bytes()` charges are 386,896
and zero respectively; active pages are the additional allowance. Resource
growth/reflow can also require transient copies, reflected in the peak column.
Explicit zero retains no history; `None` retains all input.

The linked 512 KiB probe increases allocation calls from 402,380 to 21,770,899;
at 2 MiB it increases from 1,693,532 to 21,770,897. Small caps formerly removed
individual rows before pages accumulated this much resource state. The adopted
policy permits full active-page resource growth, exposing the expensive native
admission/rebuild path seen in the uncapped probe. This allocation regression,
the higher minimum footprint, and the CPU regressions above remain performance
work. Native logical page accounting and the separate graphics budget are
unchanged; host charges cover page buffers, tables, and payload capacities.

### Verification and reproduction

All workspace library and integration tests pass, including VT, parser,
renderer/shaping, sessions, and Metal rendering. The all-target workspace check
and Rust formatting check pass. All 54 Rust and 36 native workload correctness
checks pass. SIMD/reference tests exercise short lengths, offsets, every
mismatch position, all packed fields, maximum style IDs, complete wide pairs,
and output sentinels. The allocation probe's assertions pass for both packed
versions, which produce identical results across all 14 probe cases.

The full differential suite completed **61,587 comparisons, three failures,
and zero coverage gaps**, matching the frozen baseline exactly. The failures
remain `pages/graphemes/wrap/3/1/1/alternate`, including its scalar and chunked
variants: native text length 2 versus Rust length 3. Full parity is therefore
not established; this migration introduces no new differential failures.
The independently validated scalar stage also completed 24,173 targeted
comparisons with those same three failures. JSON, opaque hyperlink bytes,
detached snapshot lifetime, GHOSTSNP v1, page/layout/resource admission, selection,
search, graphics placeholders, and saved-cursor coverage are included in the
Rust and differential checks.

Rust 1.95 optimized assembly was inspected for both targets. aarch64 contains
`cmeq.4s`, `shl.2d`, `orr.16b`, `zip2.2d`, and vector loads/stores. Baseline
x86_64 contains `pcmpeqd`, `pand`, `psllq`, `punpcklqdq`/`punpckhqdq`, and
`movdqu`; destination equality uses 32-bit halves rather than SSE4.1 `pcmpeqq`.
The source uses value casts and scalar tails without vector-alignment assumptions.
The x86_64 build was cross-compiled and inspected, not timed or executed on this
ARM host. Unsupported targets retain scalar kernels. SIMD UTF-8 transcoding
and a grapheme transition table remain separate follow-ups.

Local artifacts are under `target/packed-cells/`. The `baseline/`, `scalar/`,
and `simd/` manifests record revisions, compiler details, and executable SHA-256
hashes. `comparison/manifest.json` records the schedule and binaries;
`comparison/results.json` records both directions and normalized samples.
Criterion's estimates, confidence intervals, raw samples, and per-run logs are
retained under `comparison/`. `allocations-{before,scalar,simd}.json` and
`allocations-manifest.json` identify the independently compiled probes.
Their source is [allocations.rs](allocations.rs); it uses APIs shared with the
baseline and runs unchanged on all three revisions. Assembly extracts are in
`assembly/verified/`; verification logs and native failure artifacts are retained
beside them. [bench_compare.py](bench_compare.py) reproduces the timing schedule.

## Packed-storage recovery, 2026-09-16

The follow-up freezes `3759451f3` as its packed baseline. Its VT benchmark and
oracle hashes match the previously preserved `6c4096104` binaries. The original
56-byte-cell and Ghostty executables remain in `target/packed-cells/baseline/`.
Rust builds use 1.95.0 and the unchanged release profile. Follow-up sources,
binary manifests, validation logs and raw measurements are retained separately
in `target/packed-recovery/`.

### Stage 1: ordinary reads and writes

Small packed-cell and row-text adapters now inline, so scalar iteration can
remove unused UTF-8 encoding and bypass grapheme resolution. Printing reads
physical widths and cells through the validated cursor location. Ordinary
narrow replacements update cells and style references directly; wide-boundary
repair and resource release retain their existing path. Ordinary writes, row
resets and erases skip charge recomputation when no payload or capacity changes.

The serial runner now also accepts a pair of frozen Rust binaries and repeated
`--case` filters. Each selected workload runs baseline → candidate, immediately
followed by candidate → baseline, with 50 samples per direction, 0.3 seconds of
warmup and a 1-second measurement target. No builds, tests or profiling run
during timing. Times below pool the 100 normalized samples; below 1 is faster.

| Workload | Packed baseline µs | Stage 1 µs | Stage 1 / baseline |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| print/ascii | 26.289 | 18.631 | 0.71× |
| print/chinese | 39.151 | 34.289 | 0.88× |
| print/combining | 65.464 | 65.858 | 1.01× |
| print/emoji | 70.943 | 70.350 | 0.99× |
| read/ascii | 9.692 | 2.757 | 0.28× |
| read/chinese | 10.479 | 2.784 | 0.27× |
| read/combining | 13.022 | 5.457 | 0.42× |
| read/emoji | 12.309 | 4.222 | 0.34× |
| feed/ascii | 1.137 | 1.105 | 0.97× |
| feed/chinese | 5.409 | 5.357 | 0.99× |
| feed/combining | 73.022 | 71.208 | 0.98× |
| feed/emoji | 82.457 | 73.272 | 0.89× |
| stream/ascii | 25.269 | 23.400 | 0.93× |
| stream_styled/ascii | 31.535 | 27.961 | 0.89× |

These changes primarily recover reads and ordinary writes; grapheme append and
resource reconstruction remain for subsequent stages. All 14 original allocation
probe observations match the packed baseline exactly, including zero allocation
for ordinary writes and row exposure, bounded page recycling, memory charges,
and retained history. An additional check covers repeated plain/styled narrow
overwrites and inline backgrounds without allocation or charge growth.

VT library/integration tests pass (302 tests including the new check). The
14,325 page, layout, grid and snapshot differential comparisons report only the
three existing one-row alternate-screen grapheme-wrap failures, with zero
coverage gaps. Stage 1 artifacts are in `target/packed-recovery/stage1/`;
`comparison/results.json` retains both measurement orders.

### Stage 2: resource admission and rebuilding

Hyperlink lookup now borrows URI/ID bytes and hashes the native byte sequence
without concatenating a temporary key. Native string reservation, dead-entry
cleanup, ID preference and failure order still run before an owned payload is
created. Rebuilds share immutable link payloads and reserve sparse maps from
surviving entries. The opt-in `allocation-probe` feature counts admission,
reservation, rebuild and growth attempts, and separates temporary hyperlink
payloads, owned hyperlink payloads and page cell/header/identity buffers from
other allocations (including graphemes).

All 14 probes retain identical native admission/reservation/growth counts,
logical charges, page counts and retained rows. Classified allocation counts
and requested bytes sum to the global allocator's observations. Ordinary writes
and row exposure still allocate zero times. The instrumentation-only baseline
also reproduces every original allocation/memory observation.

| Unlimited linked-grapheme pressure | Stage 1 | Stage 2 |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Allocation calls | 21,770,860 | 283,116 |
| Allocations during rebuilds | 21,019,263 | 11,505 |
| Retained requested bytes | 32,388,863 | 32,386,655 |
| Peak requested bytes | 33,711,743 | 33,709,199 |

The allocation reduction is 98.7%, with essentially unchanged retained heap.
A preliminary dense text-slot reservation increased retained heap by about
2.2 MiB; it was removed before the following final measurements. Its evidence
is retained separately in `stage2-dense-reserve/`.

The same serial protocol compares stage 1 and stage 2, with both measurement
orders and 50 samples per direction. Normal builds, without instrumentation,
produce these pooled medians:

| Workload | Stage 1 µs | Stage 2 µs | Stage 2 / stage 1 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| read/ascii | 2.850 | 2.877 | 1.01× |
| reflow/ascii | 42.355 | 42.864 | 1.01× |
| reflow/chinese | 68.381 | 67.175 | 0.98× |
| reflow/combining | 81.820 | 81.287 | 0.99× |
| reflow/emoji | 65.335 | 65.365 | 1.00× |
| feed/ascii | 1.107 | 1.089 | 0.98× |
| stream_styled/ascii | 28.048 | 27.993 | 1.00× |
| stream_styled/chinese | 39.025 | 38.591 | 0.99× |
| stream_styled/combining | 1086.903 | 966.088 | 0.89× |
| stream_styled/emoji | 1377.203 | 1226.391 | 0.89× |
| reflow_history/ascii | 1475.254 | 1462.086 | 0.99× |
| reflow_history/chinese | 1447.533 | 1458.829 | 1.01× |
| reflow_history/combining | 7372.528 | 7269.604 | 0.99× |
| reflow_history/emoji | 5176.578 | 5163.609 | 1.00× |

Styled combining improves 10–12% and styled emoji 11% in both orders; the other
focused workloads remain close to unchanged. VT library/integration tests pass
(304 tests). The final 6,585 page, layout and snapshot differential comparisons
have only the three known alternate-screen grapheme-wrap failures and zero
coverage gaps. Formatting and diff checks pass. Artifacts are in
`target/packed-recovery/stage2/`; the instrumented stage-1 baseline is in
`stage2-probe-before/`.


### Stage 3: grapheme append and reflow

Grapheme append reuses the cursor's resolved page, copies already-valid text
without validating it again, and refreshes coordinates only after a split.
Cell copies carry their known suffix length. Resource admission reuses those
coordinates, and general row lookup finds page and relative row in one pass.
Same-page wrapped transfers retain immutable text when the base is unchanged;
character-set remapping still reconstructs the changed base. A small integer
hasher mixes physical slots into both bucket indices and fingerprints, including
row-strided keys. Style and hyperlink admission keep their native hashes.

The following 26 focused workloads use the same serial protocol and frozen
normal binaries. These are stage 3 versus stage 2, before the separate wrap fix.

| Workload | Stage 2 µs | Stage 3 µs | Stage 3 / stage 2 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| print/combining | 66.246 | 46.875 | 0.71× |
| print/emoji | 72.700 | 48.935 | 0.67× |
| read/ascii | 2.909 | 2.898 | 1.00× |
| read/chinese | 2.864 | 2.876 | 1.00× |
| read/combining | 5.574 | 3.401 | 0.61× |
| read/emoji | 4.338 | 3.199 | 0.74× |
| reflow/ascii | 42.049 | 38.442 | 0.91× |
| reflow/chinese | 67.209 | 58.898 | 0.88× |
| reflow/combining | 82.580 | 53.297 | 0.65× |
| reflow/emoji | 66.869 | 43.279 | 0.65× |
| feed/ascii | 1.095 | 1.080 | 0.99× |
| feed/chinese | 5.331 | 5.316 | 1.00× |
| feed/combining | 72.862 | 52.617 | 0.72× |
| feed/emoji | 75.519 | 54.029 | 0.72× |
| stream/ascii | 23.525 | 23.160 | 0.98× |
| stream/chinese | 34.170 | 33.858 | 0.99× |
| stream/combining | 887.489 | 676.221 | 0.76× |
| stream/emoji | 1120.349 | 783.220 | 0.70× |
| stream_styled/ascii | 28.098 | 27.993 | 1.00× |
| stream_styled/chinese | 39.040 | 38.338 | 0.98× |
| stream_styled/combining | 965.295 | 760.056 | 0.79× |
| stream_styled/emoji | 1227.682 | 883.933 | 0.72× |
| reflow_history/ascii | 1463.149 | 1278.989 | 0.87× |
| reflow_history/chinese | 1452.129 | 1253.300 | 0.86× |
| reflow_history/combining | 7233.507 | 4481.942 | 0.62× |
| reflow_history/emoji | 5215.240 | 3032.571 | 0.58× |

Grapheme printing improves 29–33%, grapheme feed 28%, and retained-history
combining/emoji reflow 38–42%. Improvements hold in both orders. Ordinary
ASCII/CJK feed and reads remain close to unchanged.

All 14 final allocation probes preserve allocation calls, admission/reservation/
growth attempts, native charges, page counts and retained rows. Removing map
hasher state slightly reduces retained heap (32,386,655 → 32,385,119 bytes in
the unlimited linked-grapheme probe); ordinary writes and row exposure remain
allocation-free. Conservative map-capacity accounting remains in place.

The final source passes 305 VT library/integration tests, including shared-text
identity, remapped bases and detached-snapshot lifetimes. Its 6,585 page/layout/
snapshot comparisons report only the three existing wrapped-grapheme failures,
with zero coverage gaps. Artifacts are in `target/packed-recovery/stage3/`.

### Wrapped grapheme correctness (separate commit)

When a one-row alternate screen scrolls away a wrapped cluster's source,
Ghostty's preceding-row pin is absent and its old suffixes are not transferred.
Rustty now follows that rule: `☺ + ZWJ + ❤` produces `☺❤` at the destination.
Surviving same-page and cross-page transfers retain their suffixes. The separate
host memory-budget policy still preserves active text when it prunes primary
history, including budgets of zero and one byte.

The regression test failed before the fix and passes afterward across both
screens, same-page/cross-page geometry and host memory limits. All 306 VT tests
pass, and all 14 allocation/memory observations match stage 3. The complete
configured differential matrix now passes **61,587 comparisons with zero
failures**, including the three previously failing delivery variants. This is
the same matrix used for the packed baseline: all suite flags and 100 generated
cases. The separate `--thorough` feature-completeness gate remains unchanged.

Two serial timing controls show no material cost: emoji feed is 51.687 → 51.756
µs and emoji stream is 773.025 → 765.904 µs (50 samples in each order).
Sources, binaries, raw timings and the full differential log are in
`target/packed-recovery/wrap-fix/`.


### Stage 4: renderer and application measurements on macOS

The expanded `prepare_frames` example and opt-in application replay share six
fixed workloads: warmed redraw, scrolling ASCII/styled output, mixed Unicode,
alternate-screen repaint, and resize/reflow with 1,000 seeded history rows.
Each process warms 50 frames and measures 50. `frame_compare.py` runs adjacent
before/after processes, reverses their order, validates the controls, and retains
all individual frames. The tables pool 100 samples per version; p95/p99 use
nearest ranks rather than Criterion's per-iteration batch averages.

The comparison uses clean archives of packed baseline `3759451f3` and wrap fix
`43f4c0c8e`. Identical measurement controls, including the desktop entry point,
were overlaid on both; `stage4/source-manifest.json` records every control hash.
Both are Rust 1.95 release builds with identical app resources and disposable
ad hoc signed bundles. No build, test, profiling or other benchmark ran during
these serial measurements.

```sh
cargo +1.95.0 run --offline --release -p rustty-render \
  --example prepare_frames -- --case mixed_unicode
RUSTTY_SMOKE_DIR=/tmp/rustty-frame-replay \
  RUSTTY_SMOKE_TIMING=mixed_unicode RUSTTY_SMOKE_OFFSCREEN=1 \
  path/to/Rustty.app/Contents/MacOS/rustty
python3 test/rustty/frame_compare.py --kind prepare \
  --before BEFORE/prepare_frames --after AFTER/prepare_frames --output RESULTS
python3 test/rustty/frame_compare.py --kind app --offscreen \
  --before BEFORE/Rustty.app/Contents/MacOS/rustty \
  --after AFTER/Rustty.app/Contents/MacOS/rustty --output RESULTS
```

The renderer probe fixes Menlo 13 pt, scale 1, a 120×40 grid and a 1200×850
pixel target. Feed/resize time is measured separately from `Renderer::prepare`.
Its thread-local Rust allocator counter remains enabled inside both timers;
these timings include that counter's overhead. It counts successful Rust
allocation/reallocation requests, not CoreText's private native allocations.
A warmed redraw here reuses font/shape caches but still calls `prepare`; the
application replay below also exercises the app's retained-frame cache.

| Renderer workload | Prepare median µs, before → after | p95 µs | p99 µs | After / before |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| cached_redraw | 472.375 → 410.396 | 478.583 → 421.875 | 482.000 → 435.125 | 0.87× |
| scroll_ascii | 463.896 → 407.541 | 470.416 → 415.833 | 478.167 → 425.250 | 0.88× |
| scroll_styled | 445.500 → 383.584 | 452.250 → 394.542 | 461.750 → 398.625 | 0.86× |
| mixed_unicode | 474.584 → 413.750 | 520.583 → 419.750 | 523.542 → 423.833 | 0.87× |
| alternate_repaint | 472.709 → 413.397 | 488.375 → 425.208 | 525.333 → 438.125 | 0.87× |
| resize_reflow | 437.666 → 371.750 | 513.083 → 428.334 | 522.916 → 432.166 | 0.85× |

Preparation improves 12–15% in pooled medians, with improvements in both
measurement orders. Its allocation counts and requested bytes are unchanged.
Ordinary/styled scrolling feed remains allocation-free within this capacity;
Unicode payloads and history reflow remain visible in their own phase.

| Renderer workload | Feed/resize median µs, before → after | Feed/resize p95 µs | Feed/resize p99 µs | Feed allocations/frame | Prepare allocations/frame | Prepare requested bytes/frame |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| cached_redraw | 0.000 → 0.000 | 0.042 → 0.042 | 0.042 → 0.042 | 0 | 812 | 996,848 |
| scroll_ascii | 0.375 → 0.375 | 0.417 → 0.375 | 0.417 → 0.417 | 0 | 774 | 1,279,184 |
| scroll_styled | 0.833 → 0.791 | 0.875 → 0.833 | 0.958 → 0.833 | 0 | 1,912 | 1,097,524 |
| mixed_unicode | 1.334 → 1.125 | 1.625 → 1.292 | 2.250 → 1.500 | 5 | 812 | 996,848 |
| alternate_repaint | 45.958 → 36.834 | 47.292 → 38.667 | 50.500 → 43.875 | 200 | 812 | 996,848 |
| resize_reflow | 1478.521 → 1056.667 | 1624.584 → 1069.667 | 1638.667 → 1098.250 | 56 | 792 | 903,248 |

Resize allocation requests fall by 192 bytes/frame at the median; counts remain
56 at the median and 68 at p95/p99. The font/frame preparation allocations are
an existing cost and were not changed in this storage follow-up.


The application replay fixes Menlo 13 pt, default in-memory settings, a
1200×850 physical window and one disposable `/bin/sleep` session. This Mac
reports scale 2, producing a 74×24 grid. It injects identical terminal inputs,
then calls the application's drawing path, including egui composition,
retained-frame handling, GPU buffer preparation, encoding and queue submission.
Timing is opt-in through `RUSTTY_SMOKE_TIMING`; the regular saved workspace and
configuration are not overwritten.

The Mac's surface reports `Occluded`. The timing replay therefore renders the
same application primitives into one reusable offscreen Metal target rather
than accepting a skipped surface render. It does not wait for GPU completion.
The numbers below describe **CPU preparation/submission**, not GPU completion
or visible presentation. Process CPU includes the app's other threads and
replay overhead; it is expressed as a percentage of one core. RSS comes from
macOS `proc_pidinfo`. No allocator counter runs in this app measurement.

| App workload | Frame wall median ms, before → after | Wall p95 ms | Wall p99 ms | Main-thread CPU median ms | After / before wall |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| cached_redraw | 0.582 → 0.625 | 0.993 → 0.832 | 1.110 → 1.030 | 0.581 → 0.624 | 1.07× |
| scroll_ascii | 1.880 → 1.563 | 2.775 → 2.644 | 2.813 → 2.835 | 1.881 → 1.564 | 0.83× |
| scroll_styled | 1.929 → 1.737 | 2.822 → 2.650 | 2.903 → 2.705 | 1.930 → 1.738 | 0.90× |
| mixed_unicode | 1.954 → 1.518 | 2.722 → 2.551 | 2.766 → 2.627 | 1.956 → 1.519 | 0.78× |
| alternate_repaint | 1.750 → 1.749 | 2.648 → 2.484 | 2.677 → 2.594 | 1.751 → 1.750 | 1.00× |
| resize_reflow | 1.313 → 1.161 | 1.919 → 1.899 | 2.236 → 2.063 | 1.313 → 1.162 | 0.88× |

| App workload | Feed/resize median µs, before → after | p95 µs | p99 µs | Process CPU %, before → after | RSS median MiB, before → after |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| cached_redraw | 1.000 → 0.917 | 2.083 → 1.500 | 2.875 → 1.667 | 2.10 → 2.14 | 108.95 → 108.81 |
| scroll_ascii | 9.167 → 8.834 | 16.750 → 14.792 | 18.000 → 17.583 | 4.55 → 4.31 | 107.00 → 106.94 |
| scroll_styled | 16.605 → 14.937 | 26.125 → 22.625 | 27.709 → 25.250 | 4.73 → 4.44 | 107.29 → 107.21 |
| mixed_unicode | 24.562 → 20.792 | 38.417 → 36.500 | 43.541 → 42.541 | 4.54 → 4.21 | 110.12 → 109.95 |
| alternate_repaint | 126.374 → 110.959 | 241.709 → 194.375 | 244.209 → 197.792 | 4.71 → 4.52 | 110.39 → 110.18 |
| resize_reflow | 4538.229 → 3887.833 | 8415.666 → 6492.042 | 9003.834 → 8296.583 | 11.66 → 10.10 | 115.02 → 115.00 |

Each replay frame follows a minimum 50 ms pause. These intervals describe the
controlled replay and OS scheduling, not display refresh latency or maximum
frame rate. Tail spikes therefore cannot establish a presentation regression.

| App workload | Interval median ms, before → after | p95 ms | p99 ms |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| cached_redraw | 52.649 → 52.589 | 53.170 → 52.994 | 90.916 → 53.345 |
| scroll_ascii | 53.667 → 53.581 | 54.955 → 54.786 | 74.329 → 89.750 |
| scroll_styled | 53.809 → 53.658 | 54.994 → 54.876 | 73.716 → 85.790 |
| mixed_unicode | 53.686 → 53.517 | 54.878 → 54.727 | 72.586 → 54.837 |
| alternate_repaint | 53.748 → 53.839 | 54.938 → 54.786 | 80.040 → 85.058 |
| resize_reflow | 58.052 → 56.789 | 61.684 → 60.407 | 64.660 → 62.045 |

Application scrolling/mixed-Unicode frame medians improve 10–22%, and the
resize frame median improves 12%; both measurement orders improve for these
cases. RSS is essentially unchanged. Cached redraw has no demonstrated gain:
its primary ratio is 1.075×, but the repeated pair is 1.011× (forward 1.123×,
reverse 1.028×). Alternate repaint is 0.999× initially and 0.964× on repeat;
it also varies by order. These two cases do not establish a repeatable change
across both orders. Their raw repeats remain in `stage4/app-confirmation/`.

Renderer/session checks and all 22 application tests pass, including the Metal
retained-frame test outside the sandbox. All six replays finish with 50 measured
frames and verified dimensions. The existing disposable smoke suite also
passes, and its offscreen screenshot was inspected after the capture refactor.
The GPU-unavailable sandbox test was rerun successfully with Metal access.
Artifacts, binaries, manifests, raw samples and logs are in
`target/packed-recovery/stage4/`; GPU completion and visible presentation remain
outside the claims of this measurement.


### Stage 5: scalar reference kernels and platform defaults

`rustty-vt` now exposes `scalar-kernels` for ARM reference validation and
measurement. Explicit vector scans/stores run only on aarch64 with NEON;
x86 and unsupported targets use the existing scalar kernels. LLVM's normal
optimizations remain enabled. The `wide` dependency is now ARM-only, and
neither parser events nor the packed representation change.

```sh
cargo +1.95.0 test --offline -p rustty-vt --lib --tests
cargo +1.95.0 test --offline -p rustty-vt --lib --tests --features scalar-kernels
cargo +1.95.0 bench --offline -p rustty-vt --bench primitives --features scalar-kernels
```

All 306 VT tests pass in both ARM modes. Default-mode tests compare every
scan/store boundary and field against the scalar implementation. The x86_64
Linux all-target check also passes; the installed Zig compiler supplies the
Criterion `alloca` helper's cross C compiler. x86 binaries were checked, not
executed or performance-tuned on this ARM host.

Four feed/stream controls use 50 samples per direction. “Previous” is the
wrap-fix binary, “default” keeps NEON, and “reference” enables `scalar-kernels`.

| Workload | Previous µs | Default NEON µs | Scalar reference µs |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| feed/ascii | 1.063 | 1.062 | 1.133 |
| feed/chinese | 5.561 | 5.560 | 5.821 |
| stream/ascii | 22.800 | 22.706 | 22.943 |
| stream/chinese | 33.916 | 33.798 | 34.801 |

Raw controls and frozen binaries are in `kernel-comparison/`, `kernel-default/`
and `kernel-scalar/` under `target/packed-recovery/`.


#### NEON decoding of validated UTF-8 groups

The candidate deinterleaves eight homogeneous two-, three- or four-byte UTF-8
scalars into the existing bounded 256-character stack buffer. Full byte extents
and all eight leading lanes are checked before decoding. Mixed groups and short
tails use the fused standard-library scalar decoder/property loop. Borrowed
parser events and invalid/partial input handling are unchanged; no owned text
or additional terminal storage representation is introduced.

Every Unicode scalar, source/output alignment, buffer capacities and sentinels
match the scalar reference. Long mixed input and malformed tails match bytewise
delivery on both screens and both feed APIs. The candidate passes 308 VT tests,
the scalar-feature tests, all 12 parser tests, and 2,512 selected parser/Unicode
parity comparisons with zero failures or coverage gaps.

After 12 focused feed/stream comparisons, all 54 workloads were measured
separately with 50 samples in each order. The complete-run medians and ratios
below compare the default kernel control with the UTF-8 candidate.

| Workload | Before µs | NEON decode µs | Forward ratio | Reverse ratio |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| feed/ascii | 1.065 | 1.067 | 1.003× | 1.002× |
| feed/chinese | 5.557 | 4.803 | 0.864× | 0.861× |
| feed/combining | 53.231 | 52.489 | 0.979× | 0.988× |
| feed/emoji | 51.886 | 51.193 | 0.988× | 0.989× |
| stream/chinese | 34.020 | 31.761 | 0.938× | 0.932× |
| stream_styled/chinese | 38.822 | 36.794 | 0.945× | 0.949× |
| stream/combining | 688.975 | 655.525 | 0.949× | 0.954× |
| stream/emoji | 797.048 | 748.825 | 0.953× | 0.932× |

The candidate clears the 5% complete-workload gate in both orders: Chinese
feed improves about 14%, plain Chinese stream 6–7%, and styled Chinese stream
just over 5%. No workload has a confirmed regression above 3%. The initially
flagged ASCII scalar scan varies from 1.492× forward to 0.856× reverse; its
repeat pools to 0.987× (1.010× forward, 0.870× reverse), so that result does not
confirm a regression. The decoder is retained.

Sources, binaries, selected parity, focused/all-54 results and the flagged-case
repeat are in `target/packed-recovery/utf8-candidate/`. All current ARM builds
inherit `-C target-cpu=native` from `/Users/byron/dev/.cargo/config.toml`, including
both clean application snapshots and both sides of these kernel comparisons.
The x86 check overrides it with `-C target-cpu=x86-64`.


#### Grapheme transition table: rejected

A separate candidate derived all 1,445 canonical transitions at compile time
from the existing rules, retained the ordinary-character shortcut, and called
the reference rules for noncanonical inputs. All 16,777,216 combinations of
u8 state and input classes matched the reference; 309 VT tests and 484 selected
Unicode parity comparisons passed.

All 12 complete feed/plain-stream/styled-stream cases ran with 50 samples in
each direction against the accepted UTF-8 decoder. None improved by 5% in both
orders. The best repeatable feed gain was only about 1.4% for combining text,
so the candidate was removed and the original rule implementation retained.
No all-54 acceptance run was needed after the gain gate failed.

| Workload | Original rules µs | Table µs | Forward ratio | Reverse ratio |

| stream_styled/emoji | 876.222 | 871.709 | 0.990× | 1.002× |

The rejected source patch, binary, tests and raw timings remain in
`target/packed-recovery/grapheme-table-candidate/`. The shipped runtime contains
no transition table or fallback machinery from this experiment.


### Final serial comparison

The final accepted runtime is the NEON decoder at `19d43ec65`; the later table
rejection/report commit does not change it. The final benchmark, oracle and
allocation executables are byte-identical to the accepted decoder's frozen
binaries. This comparison measures all 54 Rust workloads and the 36 available
native counterparts with Rust 1.95 on the same Apple M4 Max.

The runner's labels are **before** = pre-migration 56-byte cells (`c366e3768`),
**scalar** = initial packed baseline (`3759451f3`, with its then-default SIMD),
**simd** = final packed runtime, and **ghostty** = the preserved native reference.
Here `scalar` is a legacy comparison label, not the `scalar-kernels` feature.
The full forward/reverse schedule yields 19,800 normalized samples: 50 per
version per direction. All builds, tests, parity and profiling were stopped
before timing; the process check found no competing compiler or profiler.

Times below are pooled medians in microseconds per complete workload, using
the units and inputs defined above. All ratios divide final time by the named
reference; below 1 is faster. A dash means no native counterpart exists.

The paired final comparison confirms 14–31% faster scalar printing and 72–74%
faster complete text iteration than the initial packed baseline. Plain streams
improve 8–40%, styled streams 12–41%, and retained-history reflow 22–43%.
Clone time is essentially unchanged from the packed baseline and remains
51–58% lower than the pre-migration layout. These are per-workload results;
the earlier stage ratios should not be multiplied across separate runs.

Compared with 56-byte cells, ASCII and Chinese feed are now 28% and 47% faster;
plain ASCII/Chinese streams are 19% and 35% faster. Important gaps remain:
scalar printing takes 1.64–1.99× as long, grapheme feed 1.63–1.80×, and retained
combining/emoji history reflow 1.87–2.00×. Complete text reads remain 7–26% slower
than that layout despite recovering most of the packed baseline's cost.

Against the current native run, ordinary ASCII/Chinese streams take 3.85×/3.43×
as long, combining stream 1.35× and emoji stream 1.03×. The native Chinese-feed
and combining-overwrite cliffs described earlier still apply: their extreme
ratios do not describe general Unicode throughput. GPU completion and visible
presentation were not measured; the application results above describe CPU
preparation/submission from the clean storage-recovery snapshots.

The full run flagged three first-codepoint scans against the initial packed
baseline. A separate adjacent/reversed repeat, again 50 samples per direction,
produced these results. These scans visit only the first codepoint, while
`read/*` visits complete cell text including suffixes.

| First-codepoint scan repeat | Initial packed µs | Final µs | Forward ratio | Reverse ratio |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| scalar/ascii | 1.489 | 1.722 | 1.022× | 1.340× |
| scalar/chinese | 1.914 | 1.873 | 0.980× | 0.971× |
| scalar/combining | 1.437 | 1.685 | 1.140× | 1.181× |
| scalar/emoji | 1.708 | 1.715 | 1.018× | 0.980× |

The combining scan retains a repeatable regression: 14–18% in the repeat's
individual orders, about 0.25 µs per 4,096 cells at the pooled median. Emoji does
not reproduce its initial regression; ASCII remains strongly order-sensitive.
Both the original measurements and repeats are retained, rather than replacing
the full-run samples with selected results. This scan regression is against the
initial packed baseline; the separate all-54 Unicode acceptance comparison
against the post-storage default-kernel control had no confirmed regression
above 3%.

### Final allocation and memory observations

The final normal and instrumented probes exactly match the accepted stage-3/
wrap-fix observations in all 14 cases, including allocation calls, allocation
categories, resource admission/reservation/rebuild attempts, logical charges,
pages and retained rows. Ordinary ASCII, Latin-1, wide writes and row exposure
allocate zero times within capacity. The native byte and history policies,
resource limits and whole-page eviction policy are unchanged by this follow-up.

These are live requested heap bytes from the allocation probe, excluding
allocator overhead; they are not process RSS. The construction and pressure
cases count the complete newly created terminal. Both unlimited cases retain
exactly the same 8,161 history rows in all versions.

| Probe | 56-byte cells: live bytes | Initial packed: live bytes | Final packed: live bytes |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Fresh 128×32 | 234,975 | 390,735 | 390,543 |
| Unlimited ASCII; 8,161 history rows | 59,211,711 | 8,906,767 | 8,905,231 |
| Unlimited linked graphemes; 8,161 history rows | 71,790,767 | 32,388,863 | 32,385,119 |
| ASCII; zero-byte history budget | 235,199 | 390,735 | 390,543 |
| Linked graphemes; zero-byte history budget | 278,695 | 496,087 | 495,799 |

The small-screen memory floor remains higher than the pre-migration layout:
a fresh 128×32 terminal keeps a full page buffer (390,543 requested bytes versus
234,975 before migration). This follow-up preserves page ownership and capacity.
Unlimited ASCII heap falls from 59.2 MB before migration to 8.9 MB; linked
Unicode heap falls from 71.8 MB to 32.4 MB. The follow-up itself reduces temporary
allocation churn while leaving the initial packed footprint essentially intact.

Unlimited linked-grapheme allocation calls fall from 21,770,860 at the packed
baseline to 283,116 (98.7% fewer); rebuild allocations fall from 21,019,263 to
11,505. Additional row-exposure allocations remain zero, versus 598 with the
56-byte layout. Bounded recycling performs 486 allocations for 20,000 rows,
versus 20,216 before migration, with zero net live-byte growth in the final probe.
Budgeted probes preserve exactly the initial packed row counts; the improvements
do not come from additional eviction. Raw JSON and verification are in `final/`.

### Final validation and reproduction

Rust 1.95 workspace tests pass: **472 passed, two existing environment-dependent
tests ignored** (named pasteboard service and an explicitly supplied saved-layout
file). All **308 VT tests** also pass with `scalar-kernels`. Workspace all-target
checks, the x86_64 Linux VT all-target check and formatting pass. Metal-dependent
tests ran successfully outside the sandbox. All **90 benchmark correctness
checks** pass: 54 Rust and 36 native.

The final configured differential suite passes **61,587 comparisons, zero
failures and zero coverage gaps**, including snapshots, GHOSTSNP v1 wire data,
page layouts, grid operations, protocols, parser/input/Unicode/OSC cases, corpus
inputs and 100 generated cases. As before, the independent `--thorough`
feature-completeness gate is not claimed. Ghostty production terminal sources
are unchanged from `c366e3768`, and the native executables remain preserved.

```

All follow-up stages are independently committed. Clean source archives,
compiler/binary manifests, raw timings in both orders, allocation/memory JSON,
validation logs and the retained rejected experiments are under
`target/packed-recovery/`. Final artifacts are in `final/`; renderer/application
artifacts are in `stage4/`. The final runtime keeps 8-byte cells, page ownership,
bounded recycling, shared immutable graphemes and the existing public interfaces.

## Removing repeated page bookkeeping, 2026-09-16

The follow-up baseline is the settled `f3897ef8b` source. Its preserved Rust and
native executables, source archive and provenance are in
`target/packed-simplify/baseline/`. Builds use Rust 1.95.0 and the same native CPU
flags as the preceding recovery. Each candidate is compared with the preceding
accepted binary, with adjacent forward/reverse measurements and 50 samples per
direction. Acceptance requires at least 5% improvement in a target workload in
both orders and no separately confirmed regression above 3%.

Twelve fresh, matched six-second profiles cover scalar ASCII printing, plain
ASCII/Chinese/combining streams, and ASCII/combining reflow in both engines.
The nominal sampling interval is 1 ms. The table reports physical-symbol sample
shares, not inclusive call-tree percentages; inlined work can be attributed to
its caller. Raw profiles and a parsed summary are in `baseline-profiles/`,
`reflow-profiles/` and `profile-summary.json` under the follow-up artifact root.

| Rustty workload | Main avoidable work in the baseline profile |
| --- | --- |
| print/ascii | Cursor lookup 43.1%; row-width lookup 10.9% |
| stream/ascii | Row-width lookup 30.8%; cursor lookup 13.5%; layout/metadata 10.3% |
| stream/chinese | Row-width lookup 21.4%; cursor lookup 10.0% |
| stream/combining | Cursor lookup 28.3%; sparse-map rehash 7.4% |
| reflow/ascii | Cell installation 20.3%; charge refresh 12.1%; cell copy 9.6% |
| reflow/combining | Sparse-map rehash 13.3%; cell installation 11.9%; charge refresh 5.9% |

The matching native profiles put ordinary stream work in batched printing,
decoding and page reclamation. Rustty still spends substantial time repeating
page lookup and accounting around that work. This motivates four small changes:
remove the cursor-location cache, check physical widths once per active page,
defer page-layout work until growth needs it, and skip charge recomputation when
a cell copy cannot change allocated storage.

### Step 1: locate active rows without a cache

Cursor lookup now returns the page and local row in one backward traversal.
Row-width queries use that same traversal, so neither path sums history rows
or validates cached page identities. The production change removes more code
than it adds. Page identities and layout generations remain available to search.

The clean all-54 comparison is in `step1/comparison/`. An earlier focused run
overlapped independent Cargo activity and is excluded from acceptance evidence.
These medians combine both directions; the direction columns are candidate /
baseline and values below one are faster. Ghostty's combining-overwrite cliff
still limits what its unusually large overwrite times say about general Unicode
throughput.

The separate `page_spans` benchmark exercises a 1024×96 active screen and 1024
history lines, including scalar printing at the top, middle and bottom of the
screen. It leaves the standard 54-workload list unchanged. Its baseline was
built before the runtime edit; `step1/supplement/` uses the same serial runner
and 50 samples per direction.

| Supplemental workload | Baseline µs | Step 1 µs | Forward ratio | Reverse ratio |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| page_spans/print | 79.853 | 45.203 | 0.558× | 0.571× |
| page_spans/stream | 34.534 | 15.572 | 0.453× | 0.450× |
| page_spans/styled | 35.225 | 16.207 | 0.460× | 0.460× |

Validation passes 308 VT tests, all 57 Rust benchmark correctness checks, and
14,661 relevant differential comparisons with zero failures or coverage gaps.
The reverse-lookup test covers prefixes removed, truncation, and subsequent
appends. All 14 allocation/memory observations exactly match the preceding final
baseline, including zero allocations for ordinary writes and row exposure within
capacity. Formatting and diff checks pass.

The only all-54 regression flag was `scalar/chinese`. It did not reproduce
consistently: full-run ratios were 1.035×/1.120×, the isolated repeat was
1.014×/1.121×, and the repeat of all four scans was 1.016×/0.863×. Other scans
also changed direction between processes. An identical-binary control measured
0.878×/0.910×, despite both labels invoking the same frozen executable. These
short scans therefore do not establish 3% equivalence; no regression was
confirmed. All original samples and controls remain in `step1/scan-confirmation/`,
`step1/scans-repeat/` and `step1/scan-control/`. No other workload exceeded 3%
in either direction in the complete run.

### Step 2: check physical widths once per active page

The first candidate visited each active page instead of resolving its width for
every row, skipping the rows covered by each widening operation. Ghostty's
`ensureActiveColumns` uses the same page-level invariant. No cursor pointers or
additional caches were added. This candidate was rejected because the supplemental
printing check below exposed a regression; these are retained experiment results.

The focused six-case comparison passes the 5% gate. The subsequent complete
54-workload comparison against step 1 is in `step2/comparison/`. Independent
compiler jobs interrupted the first attempt; that excluded run remains in
`step2/comparison-contaminated/`. Later measurements use the existing serial
runner with process checks before and after every timed invocation. An overlap
causes the entire incomplete workload to be repeated after compilers finish;
completed workloads retain both adjacent measurement orders.

| Workload | Step 1 µs | Step 2 µs | Forward ratio | Reverse ratio |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| stream/ascii | 17.871 | 14.039 | 0.786× | 0.788× |
| stream/chinese | 27.131 | 23.373 | 0.859× | 0.855× |
| stream_styled/ascii | 22.126 | 17.957 | 0.819× | 0.804× |
| stream_styled/chinese | 31.964 | 28.110 | 0.891× | 0.868× |
| stream_memory_capped/ascii | 17.946 | 13.958 | 0.782× | 0.775× |
| stream_styled_memory_capped/ascii | 21.963 | 18.008 | 0.819× | 0.820× |

The only >3% flags were the short first-codepoint scans. ASCII changes direction
between the complete comparison (1.021×/1.216×) and repeat (1.150×/0.899×).
Emoji's flag does not repeat (1.001×/1.027×). The same-binary variability described
in step 1 still limits these scans; no regression is confirmed. The repeats are
in `step2/scan-confirmation/`.

All 309 VT tests, 57 benchmark correctness checks and 2,265 targeted differential
comparisons pass. The added regression test restores narrow pages crossing the
history/active boundary, scrolls, and verifies that every active page widens
while the wholly historical page stays narrow. All 14 allocation/memory
observations remain identical to step 1. Formatting and diff checks pass.

The supplemental stream improves 22%, but `page_spans/print` rises from 45.313
to 47.620 µs (1.060×/1.051×). A repeat is 45.920 → 47.667 µs
(1.058×/1.026×). That printing cost prevents accepting this candidate. Both
runs remain in `step2/supplement/` and `step2/supplement-repeat/`. A simpler
candidate checks whether all active pages are wide enough before entering the
original row-widening loop, retaining the existing uncommon repair path.

The accepted version uses a single `all()` check over the active pages. When
every page is wide enough, the row loop is unnecessary; otherwise the original
widening code runs unchanged. Its full comparison and validation are in
`step2b/`. This simpler guard keeps the scrolling gains and avoids the first
candidate's supplemental printing cost.

| Workload | Step 1 µs | Accepted step 2 µs | Forward ratio | Reverse ratio |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| stream/ascii | 18.053 | 13.973 | 0.770× | 0.777× |
| stream/chinese | 27.182 | 23.441 | 0.857× | 0.868× |
| stream_styled/ascii | 22.175 | 17.975 | 0.799× | 0.820× |
| stream_styled/chinese | 32.147 | 27.848 | 0.865× | 0.867× |
| stream_memory_capped/ascii | 18.251 | 14.082 | 0.761× | 0.780× |
| stream_styled_memory_capped/ascii | 22.126 | 17.901 | 0.810× | 0.809× |
| page_spans/print | 46.047 | 45.444 | 0.985× | 0.989× |
| page_spans/stream | 15.823 | 12.363 | 0.786× | 0.778× |
| page_spans/styled | 16.464 | 13.025 | 0.797× | 0.789× |

All 54 workloads and all three supplemental cases were measured in both orders.
The reflow/ASCII and combining-feed outliers disappear on repeat
(1.003×/0.998× and 1.000×/0.994×). Emoji feed is near the threshold in the first
repeat (1.020×/1.034×), then 1.018×/1.008× in a further confirmation. The scan
flags again change direction; their earlier same-binary limitation still
applies. No regression above 3% is confirmed. All measurements, including the
outliers, are retained in `comparison/`, `confirmation/` and
`emoji-confirmation/` under `step2b/`.

The accepted guard passes 309 VT tests, 57 benchmark correctness checks and
96 focused native comparisons of physical page widening. The 14 allocation and
memory observations exactly match step 1. The restored-page regression test,
formatting and diff checks pass.

### Step 3: defer layout calculations during row exposure

`PageList::grow` now calculates effective native limits only when allocating a
page or when the requested line limit has been crossed. While a row fits and
the history count is below that requested limit, raising it to the native floor
cannot affect pruning. Byte limits already apply at page allocation. Memory
pruning still runs after every exposed row, and the existing path handles native
floors and recycling when they can affect the result. No cached limits are added.

The three page-list tests cover native line/byte floors, page reuse, and row
lookup after layout changes. All 309 VT tests, 57 benchmark correctness checks
and 2,061 page-lifecycle differential comparisons pass. All 14 allocation and
memory observations exactly match the accepted step 2 baseline.

The complete 54-workload comparison is in `step3/comparison/`, with a separate
three-case large-page comparison in `step3/supplemental/`. Deferring layout work
reduces ASCII scrolling by 26% and Chinese scrolling by 15% against step 2.

| Workload | Step 2 µs | Step 3 µs | Forward ratio | Reverse ratio |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| stream/ascii | 13.910 | 10.293 | 0.741× | 0.739× |
| stream/chinese | 23.124 | 19.630 | 0.852× | 0.847× |
| stream_styled/ascii | 17.922 | 14.357 | 0.785× | 0.813× |
| stream_styled/chinese | 27.674 | 23.818 | 0.859× | 0.863× |
| stream_memory_capped/ascii | 14.102 | 10.856 | 0.772× | 0.769× |
| reflow/ascii | 39.592 | 36.473 | 0.921× | 0.921× |
| reflow/emoji | 43.396 | 38.989 | 0.898× | 0.902× |
| page_spans/print | 45.956 | 43.345 | 0.943× | 0.944× |
| page_spans/stream | 12.331 | 11.509 | 0.941× | 0.930× |
| page_spans/styled | 12.934 | 12.131 | 0.944× | 0.933× |

All six >3% flags were repeated in `step3/confirmation/`. Combining-width scan
ratios become 1.000×/1.007×, and memory-capped emoji scrolling becomes
0.970×/0.990×. None of the four first-codepoint scans remains above 3% in either
direction; emoji changes from 1.106×/1.109× to 0.895×/0.893×. The process-to-process
scan variation documented in step 1 remains a measurement limitation. No
regression above 3% is confirmed, and all repeats are retained.

### Step 4: skip unchanged charges during cell copies

`install_cell` now refreshes the page's memory charge only when the old cell or
incoming copy has grapheme or hyperlink payloads. Style admission and page
rebuilding retain their own charge refreshes. Row installation refreshes once
after releasing an existing resource-bearing prefix, since plain incoming cells
no longer refresh that charge implicitly. Allocation and eviction rules are
unchanged.

The regression test copies plain cells and rows over linked graphemes, checking
that released payloads reduce the cached charge and that it matches a fresh
calculation on the same page. All 310 VT tests, 57 benchmark correctness checks
and 2,209 page-lifecycle differential comparisons pass. All 14 allocation and
memory observations exactly match step 3.

Final correctness validation passes 474 workspace tests (two ignored tests),
310 VT tests with `scalar-kernels`, workspace all-target checking, and the
x86_64 Linux VT all-target check. The default ARM tests include scalar/SIMD
equivalence. All 61,587 configured differential comparisons pass with zero
failures or coverage gaps; the separate `--thorough` completeness gate is not
claimed. The instrumented probe matches all 14 normal allocation/memory
observations. Ordinary writes and row exposure remain allocation-free.

The first complete timing sweep is excluded in `step4/comparison-unstable/`.
Timings shifted substantially across unchanged executables and both engines:
Chinese reflow in the preceding-stage binary measured 111.592/191.924 µs in
opposite orders, while Ghostty measured 58.292/36.066 µs. Compiler/profile guards
did not detect overlapping builds or profiling. A process snapshot observed
macOS photo processing, but does not establish the cause of the drift.

With unchanged settings, a subsequent identical-binary control measured
0.997×/0.991× for Chinese reflow and 0.996×/1.001× for ASCII scrolling. The same
step-3 executable ran under both labels, with 50 samples in each direction.
These controls are retained in `step4/identical-control/`; the complete
comparison was then repeated.

The repeated 54-workload comparison and three large-page checks pass the target
gate. Plain ASCII/Chinese reflow improves 10–11% against step 3, and retained
ASCII/Chinese history reflow improves about 12%. The following ratios divide
step 4 by step 3, using 50 normalized samples in each direction.

| Workload | Step 3 µs | Step 4 µs | Forward ratio | Reverse ratio |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| reflow/ascii | 35.863 | 32.091 | 0.883× | 0.891× |
| reflow/chinese | 57.790 | 52.050 | 0.900× | 0.903× |
| reflow/combining | 48.605 | 48.710 | 1.001× | 1.004× |
| reflow/emoji | 38.673 | 37.164 | 0.972× | 0.959× |
| reflow_history/ascii | 1286.740 | 1129.118 | 0.880× | 0.875× |
| reflow_history/chinese | 1254.646 | 1108.250 | 0.879× | 0.886× |
| reflow_history/combining | 4454.383 | 4510.379 | 1.017× | 1.009× |
| reflow_history/emoji | 2992.887 | 2849.448 | 0.952× | 0.953× |
| page_spans/print | 42.349 | 42.514 | 1.014× | 1.003× |
| page_spans/stream | 10.952 | 10.958 | 1.003× | 0.999× |
| page_spans/styled | 11.639 | 11.614 | 0.998× | 0.998× |

Two workloads initially crossed 3% in one order. Memory-capped emoji scrolling
does not reproduce its flag: the repeat is 1.001×/1.006×. Emoji printing measures
1.025×/1.059× in the complete run and 1.016×/1.066× in the first repeat. A control
using the same step-3 executable under both labels then measures 1.089×/0.973×;
the next actual comparison changes direction to 0.960×/0.990×. No regression
above 3% is confirmed, but these process-to-process variations prevent claiming
3% equivalence for emoji printing or the short scans discussed earlier. All
samples remain in `confirmation/`, `emoji-identical-control/`, and
`emoji-confirmation/` under `step4/`; the complete table below retains the
original repeated-sweep values, including its flags.

### Final bookkeeping comparison with Ghostty

This fresh serial comparison measures the settled `f3897ef8b` baseline, step 3,
and the final step-4 runtime alongside the preserved Ghostty executable. It uses
Rust 1.95.0, `-C target-cpu=native`, the unchanged release profile and the same
Apple M4 Max. The final VT binaries were built before the independent
`aad2a07a9` low-latency app commit; that commit changes no VT sources.

The runner labels are `before` = settled baseline, `scalar` = step 3, `simd` =
step 4, and `ghostty` = native. These labels do not select the scalar-kernels
feature. Each workload runs the versions adjacently and then in reverse order,
with 50 normalized samples per version per direction: 19,800 samples across
54 Rust workloads and 36 native counterparts. Compiler/profile guards remained
enabled. All build, test and profiling work from this session finished before
timing or started afterward.

Times are pooled medians in microseconds per complete workload. Ratios divide
final time by the named reference; below 1 is faster. A dash means there is no
native counterpart. The table uses the complete repeated sweep in
`target/packed-simplify/step4/comparison/`, preserving its original values rather
than replacing flagged rows with their confirmations.

Across the four accepted changes, plain ASCII/Chinese scrolling takes 56%/40%
less time and styled ASCII scrolling takes 49% less. ASCII/Chinese scalar
printing improves 28%/20%. Plain reflow improves 17%/11%, and retained
ASCII/Chinese history reflow improves about 12%. These gains come from the
final paired baseline comparison; ratios from separate stage runs are not
multiplied.

Ghostty remains faster for ordinary printing and scrolling: final ASCII and
Chinese printing take 2.17×/2.23× as long, and their streams take 1.89×/2.13×.
Combining and emoji streams take 1.15×/0.86× as long. The native Chinese-feed
and combining-overwrite cliffs described earlier still apply; their extreme
ratios should not be generalized to Unicode throughput. Emoji printing and
first-codepoint scans retain the measurement limits documented above.

### Final profiles and remaining gaps

After all timed comparisons finished, both engines were sampled for six seconds
at a nominal 1 ms interval in each of the same six workloads used for the
baseline profiles. All twelve captures completed with compiler/profile guards
enabled. Raw captures, binary hashes, commands and the physical-symbol summary
are in `target/packed-simplify/step4/profiles/`.

| Workload | Final Rustty physical-symbol shares | Matching Ghostty physical-symbol shares |
| --- | --- | --- |
| print/ascii | Resource synchronization 20.4%; cursor clamping 17.2%; cell printing 29.8% | Printing 72.3%; page-width check 22.2% |
| stream/ascii | ASCII printing 24.9%; feed 18.9%; resource synchronization 9.2%; clamping 7.5% | Batched printing 28.8%; `madvise` 29.4%; UTF-8 decoding 7.2% |
| stream/chinese | UTF-8 printing 19.0%; feed 18.9%; `Utf8Chunks::next` 17.1% | Batched printing 44.7%; `madvise` 19.2%; UTF-8 conversion 13.0% |

| reflow/combining | Sparse-map rehash/insert 20.6%; installation 13.0%; charge refresh 6.7% | Column resize 48.2%; `madvise` 38.5% |

These shares normalize independently for each process. Inlining can move work
into its caller; the disappearance of a symbol does not prove that all its work
vanished. The runtime comparisons above establish the gains. ASCII-stream
layout/metadata work falls from 10.3% of baseline samples to 0.3%, and ASCII
reflow charge refresh falls from 12.1% to below the reporting threshold. Resource
charges still run for combining reflow, as required, which explains why this
step leaves that workload essentially unchanged.

The next small experiments should target repeated cursor validation and
resource synchronization within an already validated printing run, then the
`Utf8Chunks` validation pass before Unicode decoding. Plain reflow still builds
and installs individual cell copies; a span copy could remove that work when
both rows have no resources. Grapheme map insertion and rehashing remain a
separate Unicode cost. Each proposal needs its own semantic checks and the same
5% improvement/3% regression gate; these profiles do not establish gains for
unimplemented changes.

### Allocation invariants and low-latency presentation

All 14 allocation/memory observations are identical across the four accepted
steps. The instrumented probe matches these observations and records admission
and rebuild counters separately. Ordinary ASCII, Latin-1 and wide writes, plus
row exposure within capacity, allocate zero times.
Recycling 20,000 rows still performs 486 allocations with zero net live-byte
growth. The fresh 128×32 terminal uses 390,543 requested live heap bytes;
unlimited ASCII and linked-grapheme probes retain 8,161 history rows and use
8,905,231 and 32,385,119 bytes respectively. These are allocator observations,
not RSS. Resource limits, conservative charges and whole-page eviction remain
unchanged; the speedups do not discard extra history.

The independent `aad2a07a9` app commit sets
`gpu_config.surface = egui_wgpu::SurfaceConfig::LOW_LATENCY`. A Rust 1.95 release
build, native surface smoke test, screenshot inspection, and native resize/reflow
replay pass. The replay completes 50 warmup and 50 measured frames at 1200×850.
Its artifacts and source archive are in `target/packed-simplify/low-latency/`.
This verifies rendering and resizing with the requested presentation policy;
input-to-presentation latency and memory savings were not measured. The policy
stays low latency for scrolling as well; dynamic switching was not added.

The earlier renderer/application timing tables describe their stated clean
storage-recovery snapshots. They are not measurements of the final bookkeeping
changes or of the low-latency policy. All follow-up source archives, manifests,
validation logs, timings and rejected/control measurements are retained under
`target/packed-simplify/`.

## Further progress toward Ghostty, 2026-09-16

### Step 5: reuse the width already validated for printing

Printing first widens the current physical page to the logical screen width.
Cursor clamping now uses that established width directly, avoiding a second
page lookup. Other cursor operations retain physical-width clamping. There is
no additional cached state. The regression test covers narrow pages, public
cursor edits, scalar/batched printing and both screens.

All 311 VT tests, 57 benchmark correctness checks and 13,652 page, snapshot-wire
and grid comparisons pass. The 14 allocation observations exactly match step 4.
Frozen sources, binaries and validation are in `target/packed-simplify/step5/`.

The focused eight-case comparison is followed by all 54 workloads, with 50
samples per direction and the existing compiler/profile guard. Medians below
are microseconds; ratios divide step 5 by step 4. Large-page cases use the
separate supplemental comparison.

| Workload | Step 4 µs | Step 5 µs | Forward ratio | Reverse ratio |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| print/ascii | 13.639 | 11.916 | 0.862× | 0.885× |
| print/chinese | 26.330 | 24.741 | 0.937× | 0.942× |
| print/combining | 40.905 | 37.365 | 0.917× | 0.910× |
| print/emoji | 42.277 | 41.554 | 0.960× | 0.993× |
| feed/ascii | 0.921 | 0.876 | 0.963× | 0.940× |
| stream/ascii | 10.133 | 9.821 | 0.994× | 0.966× |
| stream/chinese | 19.016 | 18.971 | 1.005× | 0.997× |
| stream_styled/ascii | 14.007 | 13.690 | 0.970× | 0.983× |
| page_spans/print | 42.026 | 37.199 | 0.887× | 0.879× |
| page_spans/stream | 10.982 | 10.995 | 0.998× | 1.004× |
| page_spans/styled | 11.631 | 11.602 | 0.999× | 0.995× |

ASCII printing improves about 13%, Chinese printing 6% and combining printing
9%; the large-page printing case improves 11–12%. The only full-run flag,
emoji reflow at 1.184×/1.006×, does not reproduce: its repeat is
1.004×/0.989×. No regression above 3% is confirmed. Original measurements and
the confirmation remain in `comparison/`, `confirmation/` and `supplemental/`.
Ghostty was not remeasured for this individual step; the preceding native table
remains tied to its stated runtime until the next complete native comparison.

### Step 6: reject forced resource-check inlining

Forcing `sync_cursor_resources` to inline passes all 57 benchmark correctness
checks but fails the performance gate. The 16-case print/feed/stream comparison
uses 50 samples per direction. ASCII printing changes from 11.983 to 11.474 µs
(0.959×/0.956×), below the required 5% improvement in both orders. No other case
qualifies; ASCII and Chinese streams take 1.012×/1.019× and 1.018×/1.015× as
long. Emoji printing also flags 1.001×/1.062×, without a confirmation run since
the candidate is already rejected. The annotation is reverted. Its frozen
binaries, patch and complete measurements remain in `target/packed-simplify/step6/`.

### Step 7: inspect the preceding Unicode cell through one row

Unicode printing now borrows the cursor row once to find the preceding cell,
its width and its last grapheme scalar. This replaces repeated page lookups and
removes the unused cursor-cell adapter. ASCII retains its existing path; no
cache or stored state is added.

All 311 VT tests, 57 benchmark correctness checks and 13,652 page, snapshot-wire
and grid comparisons pass. All 14 allocation/memory observations exactly match
step 5. Frozen sources, binaries, validation and the subsequent matched
emoji-printing profiles are in `target/packed-simplify/step7/`.

The 22 affected print/feed/stream workloads were measured against step 5 with
50 samples in each order, including styled output and mixed/chunked input.
Times below are pooled medians in microseconds. None crosses the 3% regression
threshold in either order; the Chinese printing gain passes the 5% gate.

| Workload | Step 5 µs | Step 7 µs | Forward ratio | Reverse ratio |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| print/ascii | 11.995 | 12.024 | 1.000× | 1.003× |
| print/chinese | 25.004 | 23.316 | 0.935× | 0.937× |
| print/combining | 38.061 | 37.612 | 0.978× | 1.007× |
| print/emoji | 40.897 | 37.806 | 0.905× | 0.952× |
| feed/emoji | 45.154 | 42.609 | 0.918× | 0.952× |
| stream/ascii | 9.720 | 9.650 | 0.983× | 0.996× |
| stream/chinese | 18.672 | 18.655 | 1.001× | 0.998× |
| stream/emoji | 603.569 | 575.796 | 0.953× | 0.955× |
| stream_styled/emoji | 723.677 | 700.083 | 0.970× | 0.969× |
| chunked_stream_mixed/7_bytes | 305.667 | 298.146 | 0.975× | 0.976× |

This is a focused stage comparison. The complete 54-workload and native timing
table will be refreshed at the next checkpoint; the preceding Ghostty table
still describes step 4.

### Step 8a: reject standard-library validation before chunk iteration

Trying `str::from_utf8` before the existing malformed/partial-input fallback
passes parser, batched-input and benchmark checks, but none of the six Unicode
feed/stream cases improves by 5% in both orders. Chinese feed changes from
4.398 to 4.577 µs (1.040×/1.042×), and Chinese scrolling from 18.637 to 19.250 µs
(1.039×/1.029×). Combining feed improves only 0.966×/0.975×; its stream is
0.995×/0.995×. The extra validation attempt is removed. All 50 samples per
direction, the frozen candidate and its patch remain in
`target/packed-simplify/step8-std/`.

### Step 8b: reuse the existing ARM UTF-8 validator

The parser uses the already-installed `simdutf8::compat` validator on aarch64
with NEON. Valid runs remain borrowed. Errors retain the existing `utf8_chunks`
prefix recovery; the compatibility validator stops early on errors, avoiding
repeated scans of entire malformed suffixes. Other targets and `scalar-kernels`
retain the reference path. The VT feature now propagates into the parser.

The new block-edge/error equivalence test and all 13 parser tests pass with
both implementations. All 311 VT tests pass both normally and with scalar
kernels, as do 57 benchmark checks, the workspace all-target check, the x86
Linux parser check and 16,100 parser/corpus/snapshot comparisons. All 14
allocation observations match step 7. No new unsafe Rust is added.

All 26 feed/stream workloads pass the measurement gate against step 7, with
50 samples per order and no slowdown above 3% in either direction. Chinese
feed improves about 18%, scrolling 15% and styled scrolling 11–12%. Mixed
seven-byte chunks are 1–2% slower; that case does not benefit from SIMD.
Medians are microseconds; all binaries, source patches, validation and complete
measurements are retained in `target/packed-simplify/step8/`.

| Workload | Step 7 µs | Step 8 µs | Forward ratio | Reverse ratio |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| feed/ascii | 0.864 | 0.865 | 1.004× | 1.000× |
| feed/chinese | 4.410 | 3.605 | 0.821× | 0.816× |
| feed/combining | 42.732 | 42.331 | 0.991× | 0.990× |
| feed/emoji | 41.619 | 41.350 | 0.997× | 0.992× |
| stream/ascii | 9.588 | 9.603 | 1.003× | 1.003× |
| stream/chinese | 18.644 | 15.906 | 0.853× | 0.854× |
| stream_styled/chinese | 22.757 | 20.181 | 0.890× | 0.882× |
| stream_memory_capped/chinese | 19.787 | 16.927 | 0.845× | 0.857× |
| chunked_feed_mixed/7_bytes | 93.478 | 94.510 | 1.014× | 1.009× |
| chunked_stream_mixed/7_bytes | 300.578 | 305.414 | 1.020× | 1.011× |

### Step 9: reject limiting property scans to the current row

Capping the property slice before its printable-prefix scan gives the same
result as capping the scan result. The batched-input and kernel-equivalence
tests and all 57 benchmark checks pass, but the eight feed/stream measurements
do not meet the gain threshold. Chinese feed changes from 3.616 to 3.462 µs
(0.947×/0.960×), and Chinese scrolling stays at 0.999×/1.002×. No other case
improves by 5% in both orders. The candidate is reverted; its patch, binaries
and all 50 samples per direction are preserved in `target/packed-simplify/step9/`.

### Step 10: scan printable ASCII in NEON groups

The parser checks complete 16-byte groups with the already-installed `wide`
dependency, then uses the original scalar scan for the first mixed group and
the tail. Unsupported targets and `scalar-kernels` retain the scalar scan.
Parser events, control boundaries and malformed/partial UTF-8 handling are
unchanged. The byte/boundary test checks every byte value at aligned and
unaligned offsets, plus all tail lengths; no unsafe code is added.

All 14 parser tests pass with both kernels, as do 477 workspace tests, 311
scalar-kernel VT tests, 57 benchmark checks and workspace all-target checking.
The workspace renderer test requires host Metal access and passes there.
The changed parser cross-checks for x86 Linux; a broader VT cross-check cannot
compile its existing `alloca` C dependency without the missing Linux C compiler.
All 14 allocation/memory observations exactly match step 8.
The configured parser, inherited stream corpus, snapshot and 100 generated
cases pass 12,697 differential comparisons with zero failures. This does not
establish the separate `--thorough` feature-completeness gate.

The focused comparison against step 8 uses 50 samples in each order. ASCII
feed improves about 26% and scrolling 16–17%; none of the eight workloads
crosses the 3% regression threshold in either direction. Times are pooled
medians in microseconds. Frozen binaries, patches, manifests and validation
logs are retained in `target/packed-simplify/step10/`.

| Workload | Step 8 µs | Step 10 µs | Forward ratio | Reverse ratio |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| feed/ascii | 0.858 | 0.630 | 0.738× | 0.731× |
| stream/ascii | 9.547 | 7.967 | 0.834× | 0.836× |
| feed/chinese | 3.555 | 3.553 | 1.000× | 0.998× |
| stream/chinese | 15.973 | 15.831 | 0.994× | 0.987× |
| feed/combining | 42.029 | 41.788 | 0.999× | 0.989× |
| feed/emoji | 41.010 | 41.298 | 0.984× | 1.020× |
| stream/combining | 521.346 | 521.927 | 1.001× | 1.001× |
| stream/emoji | 575.712 | 566.488 | 0.994× | 0.975× |


### Step 10 checkpoint against Ghostty, 2026-09-17

This fresh serial sweep compares the accepted step-8 runtime, step 10 and the
preserved Ghostty executable on the same Apple M4 Max. Rust builds use 1.95.0
and `-C target-cpu=native`. Each workload runs adjacent versions and then the
reverse order, with 50 normalized samples per version per direction: 14,400
samples across 54 Rust workloads and 36 native counterparts. Compiler/profile
guards remained enabled; validation finished before timing started.

ASCII feed improves 27–28% in both orders, plain ASCII scrolling 17–18%, and
styled ASCII scrolling 12–13%. Memory-capped ASCII scrolling improves 15–16%.
Three workloads cross 3% in at least one order of the complete sweep:

- Styled Chinese scrolling is 1.053×/0.994×; its repeat is 0.999×/0.996×.
- ASCII scalar reads are 1.033×/1.102×, then 1.035×/1.066×. An identical-binary
  control varies by 1.053×/0.934×; the next actual comparison changes direction
  to 0.978×/0.892×.
- Emoji scalar reads are 1.109×/0.874×, then 0.792×/1.148×. The identical-binary
  control gives 1.120×/1.017×; the next actual comparison is 0.882×/1.004×.

No slowdown above 3% consistently reproduces, but the controls prevent claiming
3% equivalence for the short scalar scans. All original samples and flags are
retained in `comparison/`, `confirmation/`, `scalar-identical-control/` and
`scalar-confirmation/` under the step-10 artifact directory. The table retains
the complete sweep, rather than substituting the confirmation values.

Times are pooled medians in microseconds. Ratios below one are faster. This
replaces the step-4 table as the latest complete native checkpoint; the
baseline column here is step 8, not the earlier settled baseline.

ASCII feed and scrolling now take 1.30× and 1.53× Ghostty's time. Plain ASCII
and Chinese printing remain about 2×, Chinese scrolling 1.88×, and Chinese
reflow 2.37×. The native Chinese-feed and combining-overwrite cliffs still
apply; their extreme favorable ratios do not describe general Unicode
throughput. These are headless VT measurements. Renderer/application timings
above retain their recorded source snapshots and are not updated by this sweep.


### Step 11: retain indices while walking pages backward

Reverse page lookup now walks logical indices directly. The previous reverse
`VecDeque` iterator reconstructed its logical index from pointer differences,
then callers indexed the page again. Keeping the index removes that repeated
work in six changed lines. The compiled cursor-row helper shrinks from 520 to
404 bytes; the before/after disassemblies are preserved with the measurements.

All 311 VT tests pass with both kernels, including the existing comparison of
reverse and forward lookup through page removal, truncation and reuse. Workspace
all-target checking, the x86 Linux VT core check, 57 benchmark checks and 448
smoke/generated differential comparisons pass. All 14 allocation observations
exactly match step 10. The separate thorough completeness gate is not claimed.

Thirty printing, feed, scrolling, chunked-input and memory-capped workloads,
plus three large-page cases, use 50 samples per direction. None exceeds the
3% regression threshold in either order. ASCII printing improves 12–13%,
combining/emoji feed 11–12%, and their scrolling 8–10%. The large-page printing
case improves 13–15%, while its scrolling cases improve 1–2%.

The selected pooled medians below are microseconds. Forward/reverse ratios
compare step 11 with step 10. Native values were measured adjacently in this
stage; they are not derived by multiplying earlier ratios. Full results for
all 33 cases, frozen sources/binaries, manifests and validation are retained
in `target/packed-simplify/step11/`.

| page_spans/print | 37.697 | 32.709 | 0.870× / 0.853× | — | — |

Combining scrolling reaches 1.01× Ghostty, and ASCII feed reaches 1.18×. Ordinary
printing, Chinese scrolling and emoji overwrites still have material gaps.
The complete 54-workload table remains the preceding step-10 checkpoint;
this stage refreshes the affected workloads and their native counterparts.


### Step 12: copy unmanaged reflow cells directly

Rows whose existing headers contain no managed resources now copy their packed
cells directly into fresh reflow destinations. This removes temporary resource
copies, empty-cell clearing and admission dispatch for these rows. Wide tails
and width-one conversion keep the existing behavior; resource-bearing rows
continue through the general copy path.

A new test forces conservative managed-row hints to compare the direct path
with the existing resource-copy implementation. Snapshots match through five
target widths and resizing back, including wide characters, inline backgrounds,
styled and grapheme rows, and retained history. All 312 VT tests pass with both
kernels, along with 57 benchmark checks, workspace all-target checking, x86 VT
core checking, 39 selected native reflow comparisons and 448 smoke/generated
comparisons. All 14 allocation observations match step 11 exactly.

The twelve focused cases use 50 samples per direction. Plain ASCII reflow
improves 38%, Chinese reflow 61%, and their retained-history cases 56%/68%.
Printing and scrolling controls stay within 2%. The cost is a small slowdown
in grapheme reflow: emoji reflow initially flags 1.031×/1.001×, then repeats at
1.019×/1.026×. Emoji history initially measures 1.030×/1.040×, then repeats at
1.027×/1.026×. Combining history repeats at 1.015×/1.007×. The repeat does not
confirm a slowdown above 3%; the remaining 2–3% emoji cost is retained as a
measured tradeoff. The table preserves the original results.

Times are pooled medians in microseconds; forward/reverse ratios compare
step 12 with step 11. Native measurements are adjacent comparisons from this
stage. Sources, frozen binaries, validation, the focused sweep and confirmations
are in `target/packed-simplify/step12/`.

| Workload | Step 11 µs | Step 12 µs | Forward / reverse | Ghostty µs | Step 12 / Ghostty |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| print/ascii | 10.443 | 10.416 | 1.003× / 0.993× | 6.031 | 1.73× |
| print/chinese | 21.370 | 21.539 | 1.004× / 1.002× | 11.763 | 1.83× |
| reflow/ascii | 31.277 | 19.380 | 0.614× / 0.620× | 20.078 | 0.97× |
| reflow/chinese | 51.369 | 20.098 | 0.392× / 0.393× | 20.960 | 0.96× |
| reflow/combining | 47.574 | 48.026 | 1.007× / 1.012× | 45.762 | 1.05× |
| reflow/emoji | 36.438 | 37.132 | 1.031× / 1.001× | 28.788 | 1.29× |
| stream/ascii | 7.436 | 7.404 | 0.995× / 0.993× | 5.214 | 1.42× |
| stream/chinese | 15.226 | 15.381 | 1.017× / 1.006× | 8.548 | 1.80× |
| reflow_history/ascii | 1121.921 | 494.988 | 0.447× / 0.434× | — | — |
| reflow_history/chinese | 1109.289 | 353.745 | 0.318× / 0.319× | — | — |
| reflow_history/combining | 4442.121 | 4477.717 | 1.007× / 1.010× | — | — |
| reflow_history/emoji | 2845.209 | 2940.434 | 1.030× / 1.040× | — | — |

Plain ASCII and Chinese reflow now match or beat Ghostty in this comparison.
This stage does not close the remaining ordinary-printing, Chinese-scrolling
or emoji-overwrite gaps. The complete 54-workload checkpoint above still
identifies its step-10 source; these are the later focused reflow measurements.


### Step 13: keep ASCII batching across row wraps

Pending ASCII wraps now use the existing wrap helper before batching the next
row. Previously the first byte of each wrapped row went through scalar printing.
The out-of-margin cursor case retains that scalar call because its first print
uses the old right limit. No additional state or storage is introduced.

All 312 VT tests pass with both kernels, including the batched-input comparisons
for margins, both screens, wide/grapheme overwrites, charsets, chunk boundaries
and generation counts. Workspace all-target checking, x86 VT core checking,
formatting, 57 benchmark checks and 448 smoke/generated native comparisons pass.
All 14 allocation observations exactly match step 12.

The 26 feed/stream workloads and 12 native counterparts use 50 samples per
direction. None exceeds the 3% regression threshold in either order. ASCII
feed improves 14% in both orders; ordinary and memory-capped ASCII scrolling
also improve by 3–5%. Times below are pooled medians in microseconds, with
adjacently measured native values. Sources, frozen binaries, validation and
all measurements are retained in `target/packed-simplify/step13/`.

| Workload | Step 12 µs | Step 13 µs | Forward / reverse | Ghostty µs | Step 13 / Ghostty |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| feed/ascii | 0.572 | 0.493 | 0.862× / 0.862× | 0.477 | 1.03× |
| feed/chinese | 3.492 | 3.498 | 1.000× / 1.000× | 429.575 | 0.01× |
| feed/combining | 37.048 | 37.398 | 1.008× / 1.020× | 382.207 | 0.10× |
| feed/emoji | 36.808 | 36.392 | 0.989× / 0.987× | 16.962 | 2.15× |
| stream/ascii | 7.373 | 7.080 | 0.954× / 0.965× | 5.328 | 1.33× |
| stream/chinese | 15.421 | 15.273 | 0.998× / 0.992× | 8.673 | 1.76× |
| stream/combining | 483.269 | 482.909 | 1.005× / 0.995× | 477.584 | 1.01× |
| stream/emoji | 525.831 | 523.504 | 0.993× / 0.998× | 730.320 | 0.72× |
| stream_styled/ascii | 11.195 | 10.938 | 0.983× / 0.968× | 7.946 | 1.38× |
| stream_memory_capped/ascii | 8.228 | 7.888 | 0.961× / 0.952× | — | — |

ASCII feed reaches 1.03× Ghostty and combining scrolling stays at 1.01×. Chinese
scrolling and emoji overwrites still have substantial gaps. The native Chinese
feed and combining overwrite cliffs remain specific to those workloads. This
focused table does not replace the full step-10 checkpoint or the separately
recorded renderer/application measurements.


### Step 14: inline the cursor-row adapter at its two callers

Fresh six-second CPU profiles of step 13 and Ghostty cover ASCII printing,
ASCII/Chinese scrolling, emoji printing, ASCII reading and emoji reflow. The
Rustty emoji-print profile spends 8.5% of its samples in the cursor-row adapter.
Forcing this small private adapter to inline lets the compiler omit row metadata
that the two printing callers do not use. The standalone symbol disappears;
page lookup and resource access still happen at the callers. The source change
is one annotation, with no new state or storage.

The 12-case print/feed/stream comparison uses 50 samples per direction with
adjacent native measurements. Chinese printing initially measures
0.950299×/0.928119×: the first order narrowly misses the 5% gate. Its confirmation
is 0.947×/0.929×, meeting the gate in both orders. Combining printing/feed improve
3–4%. Emoji scrolling initially flags 0.996×/1.040×, then repeats at
0.980×/0.980×. Additional styled combining and seven-byte mixed scrolling checks
improve 2–3% and 1–2%. No regression above 3% is confirmed. All initial values
are retained below rather than replaced by the repeats.

All 312 VT tests pass with both kernels, along with 57 benchmark checks,
workspace all-target checking, x86 VT core checking, formatting and 448
smoke/generated native comparisons. All 14 allocation observations exactly
match step 13. Frozen sources, binaries, validation and the 14 distinct measured
workloads are in `target/packed-simplify/step14/`.

Times are pooled medians in microseconds. Forward/reverse ratios compare step
14 with step 13; native values come from this stage's focused comparison.

| Workload | Step 13 µs | Step 14 µs | Forward / reverse | Ghostty µs | Step 14 / Ghostty |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| print/ascii | 10.622 | 10.498 | 0.997× / 0.980× | 6.127 | 1.71× |
| print/chinese | 21.924 | 20.430 | 0.950× / 0.928× | 11.949 | 1.71× |
| print/combining | 33.201 | 32.005 | 0.967× / 0.961× | 385.933 | 0.08× |
| print/emoji | 34.116 | 34.022 | 0.999× / 0.995× | 14.902 | 2.28× |
| feed/ascii | 0.497 | 0.494 | 0.991× / 0.996× | 0.495 | 1.00× |
| feed/chinese | 3.574 | 3.547 | 0.997× / 0.991× | 434.858 | 0.01× |
| feed/combining | 37.574 | 36.231 | 0.965× / 0.966× | 400.956 | 0.09× |
| feed/emoji | 36.635 | 36.456 | 0.993× / 1.000× | 17.131 | 2.13× |
| stream/ascii | 7.147 | 7.119 | 0.995× / 0.999× | 5.283 | 1.35× |
| stream/chinese | 15.485 | 15.371 | 0.993× / 0.992× | 8.578 | 1.79× |
| stream/combining | 485.595 | 471.634 | 0.976× / 0.968× | 478.717 | 0.99× |
| stream/emoji | 523.258 | 534.836 | 0.996× / 1.040× | 736.392 | 0.73× |

The matched step-13 profiles and hashes are in `step13/profiles/`, under the
same artifact root. These are physical-symbol self-sample shares, normalized
independently for each engine; they identify candidates rather than establishing
speedups. The runtime measurements above establish this step's gain.

| Workload | Rustty shares | Ghostty shares |
| --- | --- | --- |
| print/ascii | Cell printing 41.6%; print dispatch/validation 35.6%; resource synchronization 17.0% | Printing 75.3%; page-width checks 20.4% |
| stream/ascii | ASCII printing 32.8%; resource synchronization 8.7%; pruning 6.4% | Batched printing 29.6%; `madvise` 28.4%; decoding 7.5% |
| stream/chinese | UTF-8 printing 23.1%; feed 22.1%; destination scan/store 10.1%; validation 4.7% | Batched printing 45.4%; `madvise` 18.3%; conversion 13.1% |
| print/emoji | Print dispatch 15.5%; grapheme append 9.8%; cursor-row adapter 8.5% | Grapheme release 27.0%; cell printing 20.0%; print dispatch 13.3% |
| read/ascii | Cell-text scan 97.3%; row iterator 2.7% | Cell-text scan 99.5% |
| reflow/emoji | Resize 23.7%; cell installation 15.0%; cell copying 9.1% | `madvise` 60.1%; column resize 24.8% |

Source and assembly inspection identify further repeated work: Unicode control
search decodes already-validated UTF-8 before printing decodes it again, and the
wide-cell replacement loop clears resource-free cells immediately before
replacing them. These remain separate experiments. The latest complete
54-workload comparison still describes step 10, and renderer/application
measurements retain their separately recorded sources.


### Step 15: find Unicode control boundaries without decoding ordinary groups

The parser's control search previously decoded every validated scalar before
printing decoded the same input again. Complete 16-byte groups now skip that
search when they contain neither C0/DEL nor a possible encoded C1 control.
The first mixed group and the tail use the original scalar search, starting at
a character boundary. The implementation reuses `wide`, adds no unsafe code,
and retains the scalar implementation on unsupported targets and with
`scalar-kernels`. Borrowed event boundaries and control handling are unchanged.

A new equivalence test covers every Latin-1 scalar, multibyte characters and
Unicode separators at all offsets around vector boundaries and every valid
tail. All 15 parser tests pass with both kernels, including malformed input,
partial sequences, raw string transitions and the inherited parser corpus.
All 312 VT tests also pass with both kernels, together with 57 benchmark checks,
workspace all-target checking, x86 VT core checking and formatting. The parser,
inherited terminal corpus, snapshot and 100 generated cases pass 12,697 native
comparisons. All 14 allocation observations exactly match step 14.

The 26 feed/stream cases and 12 native counterparts use 50 samples in each
order. No case exceeds the 3% regression threshold in either direction. Chinese
feed improves 24–25%, scrolling 17–18% and styled scrolling 14–15%. Both Chinese
memory-capped cases improve similarly. Mixed seven-byte input stays within 1%.
The following pooled medians are microseconds, with adjacent native values.
Sources, frozen binaries, validation and all samples are retained in
`target/packed-simplify/step15/`.

| Workload | Step 14 µs | Step 15 µs | Forward / reverse | Ghostty µs | Step 15 / Ghostty |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| feed/ascii | 0.493 | 0.491 | 0.995× / 0.997× | 0.485 | 1.01× |
| feed/chinese | 3.530 | 2.669 | 0.758× / 0.755× | 433.978 | 0.01× |
| feed/combining | 36.347 | 35.512 | 0.977× / 0.977× | 389.911 | 0.09× |
| feed/emoji | 36.649 | 35.690 | 0.953× / 0.973× | 17.146 | 2.08× |
| stream/ascii | 7.120 | 7.145 | 1.002× / 0.999× | 5.278 | 1.35× |
| stream/chinese | 15.394 | 12.655 | 0.828× / 0.820× | 8.598 | 1.47× |
| stream/combining | 472.202 | 463.886 | 0.983× / 0.983× | 481.339 | 0.96× |
| stream/emoji | 517.376 | 509.014 | 0.994× / 0.977× | 726.933 | 0.70× |
| stream_styled/chinese | 19.416 | 16.643 | 0.855× / 0.861× | 34.100 | 0.49× |
| chunked_stream_mixed/7_bytes | 282.929 | 281.670 | 0.994× / 1.006× | — | — |
| stream_memory_capped/chinese | 16.050 | 13.233 | 0.826× / 0.824× | — | — |
| stream_styled_memory_capped/chinese | 20.165 | 17.191 | 0.848× / 0.859× | — | — |

Chinese scrolling reaches 1.47× Ghostty, down from 1.79× at the previous focused
checkpoint. Combining and emoji scrolling remain faster than Ghostty in this
comparison. The native Chinese-feed cliff still prevents generalizing its
favorable ratio; Chinese scrolling is the useful complete-stream comparison.
This stage leaves ordinary printing, cell reading and renderer/application
measurements to their separately recorded source checkpoints.


### Step 16: release resources without blanking ordinary replacement cells

The general cell writer already updates style references explicitly. It now
calls the clearing helper only for cells with grapheme or hyperlink payloads.
Ordinary wide cells are replaced directly, avoiding a blank write and repeated
resource checks immediately before the replacement. Boundary repair, style
reference changes, payload release and charge refresh retain their existing
ordering and behavior.

All 312 VT tests pass with both kernels, along with 57 benchmark checks,
workspace all-target checking, x86 VT core checking and formatting. All 2,509
page-lifecycle and generated native comparisons pass. All 14 allocation observations exactly
match step 15, including allocation-free ordinary writes and row exposure.

The four printing and 26 feed/stream workloads use 50 samples per direction.
None exceeds the 3% regression threshold in either order. Chinese scalar
printing improves 11%; its feed and stream cases gain only about 1–2% because
most of their ordinary writes already use the batched path. The other scalar
printing cases remain within 2%, including the small emoji-printing increase
shown below. Sources, frozen binaries, validation and all measurements are in
`target/packed-simplify/step16/`.

Times are pooled medians in microseconds, with adjacent native comparisons.
Forward/reverse ratios compare step 16 with step 15.

| Workload | Step 15 µs | Step 16 µs | Forward / reverse | Ghostty µs | Step 16 / Ghostty |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| print/ascii | 10.347 | 10.372 | 1.005× / 1.002× | 6.078 | 1.71× |
| print/chinese | 20.624 | 18.292 | 0.886× / 0.888× | 11.974 | 1.53× |
| print/combining | 31.917 | 32.139 | 1.005× / 1.011× | 383.856 | 0.08× |
| print/emoji | 33.705 | 34.130 | 1.008× / 1.016× | 14.806 | 2.31× |
| feed/ascii | 0.493 | 0.490 | 0.998× / 0.987× | 0.485 | 1.01× |
| feed/chinese | 2.670 | 2.630 | 0.986× / 0.983× | 434.015 | 0.01× |
| feed/emoji | 36.086 | 35.800 | 0.997× / 0.974× | 17.075 | 2.10× |
| stream/ascii | 7.124 | 7.112 | 1.004× / 1.003× | 5.215 | 1.36× |
| stream/chinese | 12.631 | 12.495 | 0.996× / 0.981× | 8.542 | 1.46× |
| stream/combining | 464.745 | 461.461 | 0.996× / 0.989× | 479.780 | 0.96× |
| stream/emoji | 500.599 | 502.141 | 0.991× / 1.021× | 726.945 | 0.69× |
| stream_styled/chinese | 16.651 | 16.453 | 0.989× / 0.990× | 34.111 | 0.48× |

Chinese scalar printing reaches 1.53× Ghostty. Ordinary ASCII printing and
emoji overwrites still have larger gaps. The latest full 54-case checkpoint
remains step 10; these later tables report their own freshly measured sources.


### Step 17: try validated Unicode runs before scalar fallback

UTF-8 printing previously printed one scalar before every batch attempt, even
when the existing batch checks could admit the whole run. It now tries that
run first and uses scalar printing when the checks reject it. Pending wraps,
public cursor columns beyond the logical edge and partial-width physical rows
explicitly take the scalar path, preserving extension, clamping and repair.

All 312 VT tests pass with both kernels, together with 57 benchmark checks,
workspace all-target checking, the x86 VT core check and formatting. The parser,
terminal corpus, snapshots, page lifecycle and 100 generated cases pass 14,758
native comparisons. All 14 allocation observations match step 16. The expanded
partial-row test compares batched Latin-1 and Chinese writes against scalar
snapshots on both screens, including a public cursor column of `usize::MAX`.

The first candidate also rejected singleton batches. Although mixed feed
improved 6–7%, styled combining scrolling regressed 3.5%/4.3%, and its
memory-capped counterpart regressed 3.6%/3.2%. Restoring singleton batches
keeps ASCII bases between combining marks on their existing path. Both
candidates' complete measurements remain in `target/packed-simplify/step17/`
and `step17b/`; only the revised candidate is retained.

The revised 26-case feed/stream sweep uses 50 samples in each order. No case
exceeds the 3% regression threshold in either order. Mixed scrolling delivered
in 4-KiB chunks improves 6.4%/5.5%, meeting the acceptance threshold. Mixed
feed improves about 4–5%; its seven-byte delivery is effectively unchanged.
Combining scrolling takes about 1% longer, as shown below. Times are pooled
medians in microseconds; native values were measured adjacently.

| Workload | Step 16 µs | Step 17 µs | Forward / reverse | Ghostty µs | Step 17 / Ghostty |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| feed/emoji | 36.029 | 36.091 | 1.007× / 0.995× | 17.213 | 2.10× |
| stream/chinese | 12.464 | 12.144 | 0.975× / 0.970× | 8.665 | 1.40× |
| stream/combining | 462.932 | 468.159 | 1.008× / 1.010× | 485.900 | 0.96× |
| stream_styled/combining | 547.958 | 553.655 | 1.013× / 1.009× | 483.678 | 1.14× |
| chunked_feed_mixed/whole | 65.517 | 62.395 | 0.957× / 0.951× | — | — |
| chunked_stream_mixed/7_bytes | 279.495 | 278.980 | 0.996× / 1.000× | — | — |
| chunked_stream_mixed/4_KiB | 202.637 | 190.523 | 0.936× / 0.945× | — | — |


### Step 18: reuse the preceding cell when appending graphemes

Printing already resolves the preceding cell to decide whether a character
joins its grapheme. It now carries that cell and the known suffix length into
append. This removes a second row validation, row lookup, grapheme lookup and
full cursor clone. The existing allocation supplies both its last scalar and
length; ordinary cells still need no resource lookup. With segmentation
disabled, grapheme lookup is limited to characters that can actually append.
Width changes and wrapping retain their existing resource handling.

All 312 VT tests pass with both kernels, together with 57 benchmark checks,
workspace all-target checking, x86 VT core checking and formatting. All 2,509
page-lifecycle and generated native comparisons pass, and all 14 allocation
observations match step 17. The existing maximum-length snapshot test now
covers segmentation both enabled and disabled, retaining the detached snapshot
while the live 260-byte cluster reaches its suffix limit and is later erased.

The first candidate hoisted the grapheme-mode check onto the ASCII path:
emoji feed improved 7–8%, but ASCII scalar printing regressed 6.7%/7.1%.
Keeping the check inside the Unicode branch restores ASCII printing to
1.000×/0.998×. The rejected candidate remains in `target/packed-simplify/step18/`;
the revised source, binaries and measurements are in `step18b/`.

All 30 printing, feed, scrolling, chunked-input and memory-capped workloads
use 50 samples per direction. None exceeds the 3% regression threshold in
either order. Emoji printing/feed improves about 8%, emoji scrolling 7%,
combining feed 6–7% and combining scrolling 5–6%. Times below are pooled
medians in microseconds, with adjacent native comparisons.

Emoji feed reaches 1.92× Ghostty and styled combining scrolling 1.09×.
Ordinary printing and scrolling still have gaps. These are focused headless
measurements; the complete table and application measurements retain their
separately identified source checkpoints.


### Step 19: make every Unicode block index valid

The Unicode property table now pads unused block IDs through the maximum
`u8` index. Its original 55,808 bytes are unchanged; 18,432 zero bytes bring
the read-only table to 74,240 bytes. This lets the compiler prove both property
byte loads are in bounds and inline the lookup, without unsafe indexing. The
previous standalone helper occupied 128 bytes and included two bounds checks.
The generator still verifies every property against its uncompressed input;
regeneration from the pinned Unicode 17 data leaves the range oracle unchanged.

Chinese feed improves 15.1%/15.6% in forward/reverse order, Chinese scrolling
11.4%/11.1%, and styled Chinese scrolling 8.4%/7.7%. Width lookup improves
about 30% for ASCII and Chinese and 21% for combining text. The data increase
is static; it adds no per-terminal allocation or resource-accounting charge.

All 312 VT tests pass with both kernels, along with 57 benchmark checks,
workspace and x86 core checks, formatting, and 488 workspace tests. The two
opt-in native-window tests remain ignored; their application paths are unchanged.
The configured differential matrix (`--corpus --input --parser --osc --unicode
--snapshots --snapshot-wire --protocols --grid --page-layout --pages`, plus
100 generated cases) passes all 61,587 comparisons with no failures or coverage
gaps. The separate, intentionally incomplete `--thorough` gate was not run.
All 14 allocation and memory observations exactly match step 18, including
zero allocations for ordinary writes and row exposure within capacity.

### Step 19 checkpoint against Ghostty (2026-09-17)

These are fresh adjacent comparisons of the frozen step 18 and step 19
executables against the preserved native executable: all 54 Rust workloads
and 36 native counterparts, 50 samples per direction, 14,400 samples total.
Rust 1.95.0, native CPU flags, warmup and sampling settings are unchanged.
The initial 12 cases and remaining 42 cases ran serially without competing
builds, tests, allocation probes or profiles. Raw data, manifests and the
combined table are under `target/packed-simplify/step19/all-workloads/`.
Times are pooled medians in microseconds; smaller ratios are faster.

Width lookup, ASCII feed, ordinary reflow and cloning now match or beat
Ghostty in these workloads. Ordinary scrolling, direct scalar printing, text
reading and emoji overwrites still need work. Native Chinese feed and combining
overwrite workloads retain their previously investigated resource-admission
cliffs; their extreme ratios do not establish general Unicode superiority.

The original sweep flagged the four short scalar scans and Chinese reflow.
All original results above are retained. Identical-binary controls and actual
repeats produced the following per-direction ratios:

| Workload | Original forward / reverse | Identical-binary control | Actual repeat |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| scalar/ascii | 0.978× / 1.143× | 0.872× / 1.159× | 0.916× / 1.018× |
| scalar/chinese | 1.050× / 0.840× | 1.016× / 0.997× | 0.876× / 0.759× |
| scalar/combining | 0.998× / 1.244× | 1.015× / 0.875× | 1.136× / 0.991× |
| scalar/emoji | 1.119× / 0.770× | 1.010× / 1.146× | 1.002× / 1.006× |
| reflow/chinese | 1.034× / 1.016× | — | 1.010× / 1.018× |

No slowdown above 3% reproduces consistently. The scalar scans are too
variable to establish equivalence within 3%; the identical-binary control
also changes substantially with measurement order. Controls and repeats are
in `step19/scalar-identical-control/` and `step19/confirmation/`; favorable
repeats do not replace the complete comparison.


### Clean renderer and application checkpoint: step 13 → step 19

Both sides were built from frozen source with Rust 1.95.0 and native CPU flags.
The baseline is `23fb5d5fb`; the candidate overlays only the step-19 Unicode
generator/table on the committed step-18 archive. Application, renderer, font,
Rustty facade and replay-control sources are identical across these snapshots.
Manifests record source and executable hashes under
`target/packed-simplify/frame-checkpoint/{before,step19}/`. All six fixed cases
use Menlo 13, 1200 × 850 pixels, 50 warmup frames and 50 measured frames per
direction. The preparation probe uses a 120 × 40 terminal; the application
uses its recorded cell geometry. No builds, tests or profiling overlapped these measurements. The CPU
profiles below ran after the initial replay.

Frame preparation, measured separately from feed, is broadly unchanged.
The table retains pooled medians and individual-frame tails in microseconds
(step 13 → step 19):

| Case | Prepare median µs | p95 µs | p99 µs |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| cached_redraw | 420.334 → 418.146 | 428.416 → 424.167 | 435.083 → 428.250 |
| scroll_ascii | 415.958 → 417.229 | 425.625 → 423.791 | 436.667 → 431.375 |
| scroll_styled | 400.979 → 397.104 | 412.916 → 430.875 | 469.666 → 440.250 |
| mixed_unicode | 418.750 → 420.813 | 426.542 → 429.917 | 430.667 → 430.750 |
| alternate_repaint | 419.916 → 429.000 | 426.583 → 488.666 | 433.375 → 493.250 |
| resize_reflow | 387.271 → 385.166 | 436.459 → 468.416 | 465.000 → 482.958 |

Terminal work in the preparation probe and allocation observations:

| Case | Feed/resize median µs | p95 µs | p99 µs | Terminal allocations | Prepare allocations | Prepare requested bytes |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |

| mixed_unicode | 0.750 → 0.667 | 1.000 → 0.875 | 4.667 → 0.917 | 5 → 5 | 812 → 812 | 996,848 → 996,848 |
| alternate_repaint | 28.375 → 23.833 | 29.667 → 26.792 | 30.209 → 28.542 | 200 → 200 | 812 → 812 | 996,848 → 996,848 |
| resize_reflow | 925.938 → 926.188 | 949.000 → 1,024.833 | 993.958 → 1,045.875 | 56 → 56 | 792 → 792 | 903,248 → 903,248 |

Allocation samples are unchanged. Alternate-screen terminal feed improves
about 16%, while renderer preparation remains near 0.4 ms. These core changes
do not establish an application-frame speedup.

The disposable application submits real draw commands to an offscreen Metal
texture. Wall time covers CPU preparation and submission, excluding terminal
feed; thread CPU time excludes scheduling waits. Both are milliseconds below.
GPU completion and visible presentation are not measured.

| Case | Frame wall median ms | p95 ms | p99 ms | Thread CPU median ms | p95 ms | p99 ms |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |

Application terminal work, process CPU and resident memory:

| Case | Feed/resize median µs | p95 µs | p99 µs | Process CPU % of one core | RSS median MiB |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| cached_redraw | 0.708 → 0.645 | 1.291 → 1.625 | 2.625 → 1.875 | 2.07 → 2.08 | 109.09 → 108.94 |
| scroll_ascii | 7.500 → 6.958 | 12.000 → 12.625 | 15.875 → 16.375 | 5.21 → 5.14 | 107.04 → 107.06 |
| scroll_styled | 12.666 → 13.646 | 18.000 → 19.459 | 25.250 → 24.834 | 5.25 → 5.33 | 107.48 → 107.45 |
| mixed_unicode | 18.834 → 18.688 | 27.708 → 24.708 | 30.542 → 33.334 | 4.11 → 4.98 | 110.30 → 110.12 |
| alternate_repaint | 72.645 → 110.584 | 147.375 → 125.625 | 194.583 → 127.459 | 4.24 → 4.33 | 110.53 → 110.36 |
| resize_reflow | 3,635.042 → 3,925.417 | 7,021.917 → 7,046.250 | 7,047.250 → 7,076.167 | 10.05 → 9.97 | 116.26 → 115.06 |

The replay deliberately pauses at least 50 ms between frames. These intervals
therefore measure the replay schedule, not typing latency or display latency:

| Case | Interval median ms | p95 ms | p99 ms |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| cached_redraw | 52.660 → 52.651 | 52.969 → 53.086 | 53.247 → 90.836 |
| scroll_ascii | 54.471 → 54.408 | 54.776 → 54.768 | 55.749 → 60.002 |
| scroll_styled | 54.479 → 54.468 | 54.837 → 54.807 | 56.831 → 55.366 |
| mixed_unicode | 53.407 → 54.440 | 54.678 → 54.745 | 54.743 → 63.435 |
| alternate_repaint | 53.501 → 53.706 | 54.740 → 54.703 | 96.365 → 57.173 |
| resize_reflow | 56.762 → 56.805 | 60.684 → 61.656 | 61.964 → 103.521 |

Raw data are in `frame-checkpoint/prepare-step19/` and `app-step19/`.
Reflow alternates between two terminal widths, producing two timing modes;
pooled medians can move differently from per-direction medians. The replay
shows order-dependent variation and isolated long frame intervals. The
existing `LOW_LATENCY` setting remains enabled on both sides.


Confirmation runs retain the original tables above. Frame-thread CPU ratios
for step 19 / step 13 were:

| Case | Original forward / reverse | Repeat forward / reverse |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| mixed_unicode | 0.994× / 1.865× | 0.977× / 1.002× |
| scroll_styled | 1.008× / 1.056× | 1.034× / 0.983× |
| resize_reflow | 0.990× / 1.061× | 1.085× / 0.922× |

The 1.865× mixed-Unicode outlier does not reproduce. Styled and resize
variations change direction; these runs do not establish 3% application-frame
equivalence. Preparation repeats also retain their original results:

| Case | Original forward / reverse | Repeat forward / reverse |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| scroll_styled | 1.047× / 0.982× | 1.012× / 1.007× |
| alternate_repaint | 1.046× / 1.000× | 1.028× / 1.008× |
| resize_reflow | 1.041× / 1.024× | 0.979× / 1.050× |

Raw repeats are in `app-step19-confirmation/` and
`prepare-step19-confirmation/`. Neither CPU submission nor the artificial
replay intervals establish GPU or typing latency.

### Fresh matched profiles at step 19

Six cases were sampled for both engines for six seconds each at a requested
1 ms interval, after the initial renderer/application runs and without other
measurements or builds. Raw captures, exact commands, executable hashes and
self-sample summaries are in `target/packed-simplify/step19/profiles/`.

ASCII printing spends 45.7% of self samples in `put_cell`, 32.6% in print
dispatch and validation, and 17.6% in cursor-resource synchronization. Emoji
printing still spends time in append bookkeeping (10.4%), memory copying
(10.2%), freeing (10.7%), clearing and resource accounting. Its duplicate row
view helper is gone. Emoji reflow spends 15.8% in cell installation and 8.6%
in cell copying. These profiles support removing repeated caller work and
resource lookups before adding another storage representation.


### Step 20 experiment: inlining the scalar cell writer (rejected)

Fresh profiles identified `put_cell` as 45.7% of ASCII-print self samples.
Forcing this private wrapper to inline did not improve any of the four
printing workloads by 5% in both orders. ASCII printing worsened from
10.415 to 10.841 µs (1.029×/1.043×); Chinese printing was 0.961×/1.004×,
and combining and emoji printing were effectively unchanged. The annotation
is reverted. The 312 VT tests and 57 benchmark checks passed, but no broader
performance sweep was needed to reject a candidate with no qualifying gain.
Frozen source, binaries and all 50 samples per direction remain under
`target/packed-simplify/step20/`.


### Step 21 experiment: explicit text-enum discriminant (rejected)

An explicit `repr(u8)` on private `CellTextStorage` did not produce a repeatable
5% improvement. ASCII text reading changed from 2.663 to 2.628 µs
(0.986×/0.988×); Chinese, combining and emoji reads were flat or up to 1.5%
slower. All six clean-source frame-preparation cases also missed the 5%
threshold in at least one order. Their allocation samples are unchanged.
The annotation is reverted; the representation and public interfaces remain
as before. All 312 VT tests, exhaustive scalar/text equivalence and 57
benchmark checks passed. Frozen code and read measurements are in `step21/`;
renderer sources and measurements are in `frame-checkpoint/step21/` and
`frame-checkpoint/prepare-step21/`. Both use 50 samples in each order.


### Step 22 experiment: reverse active-row header lookup (deferred)

Replacing the forward history walk in `row_header_mut` with the existing
reverse lookup improves standard ASCII scrolling by 2–3% in both orders.
On the existing multi-page viewport cases, plain scrolling improves
4.1%/4.4% and styled scrolling 4.2%/3.3%; printing is unchanged. An inlined
variation reduces these gains to roughly 1–3%. Neither version reaches 5%
in both orders, so neither is retained at this checkpoint. Both pass 312
VT tests and 57 benchmark checks. The original and revised patches, frozen
binaries, and standard/multi-page 50-sample comparisons are preserved in
`target/packed-simplify/step22/` and `step22b/`.


### Step 23: reuse the validated row through an ordinary write

Width validation and scalar writing previously located the same cursor row
independently. Validation now returns its location to the writer. Wrapping
and insertion refresh it, and resource growth keeps its existing relocation
path. The public cursor value is still checked against its admitted style
and link; the location lives only within the current operation. A debug
assertion checks that the supplied location still matches the cursor.

The first version shared an out-of-line synchronization wrapper. Although
ASCII printing improved 7.5–8.8%, most feed/stream cases took 1–2% longer and
one memory-capped ASCII direction reached 3.4% (not subsequently confirmed).
The retained version shares only the readonly resource-match predicate and
keeps the existing synchronization entry point for other callers. Both full
datasets remain in `step23/` and `step23b/`.

The retained version passes all 30 printing/feed/stream comparisons and all
three existing multi-page cases, using 50 samples per direction. No case
exceeds the 3% regression threshold in either order. ASCII printing improves
6.5%/11.4%, and multi-page printing 11.1%/10.7%. Combining and emoji complete
feed improve about 3%; ordinary scrolling is effectively unchanged. Times
below are pooled microsecond medians, with freshly adjacent native timings.

| page_spans/styled | 8.506 | 8.498 | 1.001× / 1.000× | — | — |

Validation passes 312 VT tests with each kernel, 57 benchmark checks,
workspace/all-target checks, x86 core checks, formatting, and 2,509 native
page/generated comparisons with zero failures or coverage gaps. All 14
allocation observations match step 19, including allocation-free ordinary
writes and row exposure within capacity. The validated source matches the
frozen measured binaries. This focused parity run does not replace the
61,587-comparison configured suite recorded at step 19 or establish the
separate `--thorough` feature gate.

### Step 24 experiment: construct appended text in its final Arc (rejected)

Two versions removed the 260-byte scratch buffer and copied the prefix and
suffix directly into the existing `Arc<str>` representation, after native
admission. Neither reaches a 5% improvement in both orders. The safe slice
initialization version adds an atomic uniqueness check; emoji feed measures
0.997×/0.977× and combining feed 1.025×/1.029×. Initializing the uniquely owned
allocation directly removes that check but still gives only 0.990×/0.988× for
emoji feed, with combining feed at 1.008×/1.022×.

The second version also produces an ASCII-print regression despite unchanged
instruction counts in both printing helpers. Its initial 0.975×/1.134× result
repeats at 1.174×/1.186×; identical-baseline controls in that repeat are
1.001×/1.004×. Instruction count alone does not establish equivalent runtime
behavior. Both versions are reverted. Each passed 313 default VT tests and
57 benchmark checks, including the added 1–4-byte append/snapshot checks up
to the 64-suffix limit. Frozen patches, binaries, all six primary cases, and
the ASCII control are retained under `step24/` and `step24b/`.

### Step 25 experiment: skip empty discard bookkeeping (rejected)

Returning early when no row IDs were removed and the viewport was already
at the bottom improves the four ordinary/styled ASCII scrolling cases by
only 1–3%. Existing multi-page scrolling worsens 14.1%/14.9%, and styled
scrolling 12.3%/13.0%. The guard is reverted. All 313 default VT tests and
57 benchmark checks passed, including public viewport clamping with an
empty removal list. All seven measured cases, source and binaries are
preserved in `target/packed-simplify/step25/`.

### Step 26: expose initialized rows without clearing them again

Unused page capacity already contains blank cells and reset, dirty row
headers. Page creation, truncation, prefix removal and recycling maintain
that invariant. Exposing a row with the default background now assigns its
identity and advances the row count. Other backgrounds reuse `reset_row`.
Debug assertions check blank cells and dirty headers; the new test exercises
new, truncated, rotated and recycled rows containing styles, links and
graphemes, with default, indexed and RGB backgrounds.

The first version removed cell clearing but retained header resetting and
separate background filling. Its 41-case sweep improved scrolling but slowed
ASCII feed 18.5–18.8%. Reusing the background reset path fixed feed; that
second version still slowed ASCII printing 3.8%/8.3% on confirmation. The
final version also reuses the initialized header. All three frozen patches,
binaries and datasets remain in `step26/`, `step26b/` and `step26c/`.

The final version measures all 38 printing/feed/scroll/reflow cases plus the
three existing multi-page cases, with 50 samples in each order. Ordinary
ASCII scrolling improves 12.3% in both orders, Chinese scrolling 7.6–7.9%,
and multi-page scrolling about 15%. Memory-capped ASCII scrolling improves
14–18%. ASCII feed is unchanged. Emoji print/feed measures 1–3% slower; the
Unicode overwrite gap remains. Times below are pooled microsecond medians,
with native timings measured adjacently for each applicable case.

| Workload | Step 23 µs | Step 26 µs | Forward / reverse | Ghostty µs | Step 26 / Ghostty |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |

| page_spans/styled | 8.474 | 7.308 | 0.853× / 0.868× | — | — |

Combining-text printing initially flagged at 1.063×/0.979×. Its confirmation
measures 1.002×/0.930×, with identical-baseline controls at 1.007×/0.938×.
The slowdown does not reproduce, but that control variation does not establish
3% timing equivalence. The original samples are retained alongside the
confirmation, and no stage ratios are multiplied to produce Ghostty ratios.

Validation passes 313 VT tests with each kernel, 57 benchmark checks,
workspace/all-target and x86 core checks, formatting, and 2,509 native
page/generated comparisons with zero failures or coverage gaps. All 14
allocation observations exactly match step 23, including allocation-free
ordinary writes and row exposure within capacity. The full workspace run
passes 480 tests with two opt-in platform tests ignored; it runs outside the
sandbox because the retained-GPU-frame test needs a Metal adapter. Validated
Rust source matches the frozen measured patch. The focused parity run does
not replace the complete configured suite recorded at step 19.

### Step 27 experiment: share the screen borrow during scalar writes (rejected)

Selecting the active screen once for charset mapping and cell writing removes
a repeated selection, but does not improve any printing case by 5% in both
orders. ASCII printing measures 9.024 → 10.577 µs (1.151×/1.202×); Chinese,
combining and emoji printing stay within 2%. The change is reverted. All
313 default VT tests and 57 benchmark checks passed. Frozen binaries, source
and all four 50-sample comparisons remain in `target/packed-simplify/step27/`.

### Step 28 experiments: reuse the location through grapheme append (rejected)

Using the validated row for Unicode's preceding-cell lookup alone falls short
of a 5% gain in both orders. Carrying that location through append improves
emoji printing and complete feed about 10%, but produces an ASCII-print
regression. Reducing the append argument list restores the original printing
stack-frame size without fixing that regression. Keeping the original
preceding-cell lookup narrows the change and retains a 7–8% emoji gain; ASCII
printing still fails the regression check. None of these variants is retained.

| Variant | Emoji print forward / reverse | Emoji feed forward / reverse | ASCII print forward / reverse |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Preceding row only (`step28`) | 0.969× / 0.978× | 0.965× / 0.984× | 1.005× / 1.207× |
| Row and append (`step28b`) | 0.902× / 0.898× | 0.892× / 0.900× | 0.924× / 1.126× |
| Fewer append arguments (`step28c`) | 0.906× / 0.913× | 0.923× / 0.908× | 1.111× / 1.193× |
| Append only (`step28d`) | 0.917× / 0.919× | 0.925× / 0.921× | 1.042× / 1.081× |

The second variant's ASCII repeat measures 0.935×/1.113×, with identical
baseline controls at 0.882×/1.025×. The final variant repeats at
1.073×/1.015×, with controls at 0.979×/1.001×. The final forward slowdown
reproduces. A smaller instruction count and restored stack-frame size did
not establish faster execution; the runtime cause of the ASCII sensitivity
remains unresolved. All four variants pass 313 default VT tests and 57
benchmark checks. Frozen patches, binaries, initial samples and controls are
retained under `target/packed-simplify/step28{,b,c,d}/`.

### Step 29 experiments: eager packed-codepoint validation (rejected)

An eager `then_some` expression preserves Unicode validation and simplifies
the accessor, but slows ASCII text reading 44.1%/43.4% while improving scalar
scans 9.9%/5.6%. Assembly confirms that empty cells now execute the character
validation instructions in the text-reading loop. Restoring the empty-cell
early return restores text reading (1.001×/0.997×), but scalar scans measure
0.874×/1.086× and no longer qualify in both orders. Both versions are reverted.
Each passes 314 VT tests and 57 benchmark checks, including checks for invalid
Unicode and arbitrary public cell bits. Source, binaries and 50-sample
comparisons are retained in `target/packed-simplify/step29/` and `step29b/`.

### Step 30 experiment: mark a replaced row once (rejected)

Moving the row-metadata update outside the general cell-replacement loop
improves Chinese printing 5.8%/5.4%, but ASCII printing regresses 9.4%/24.9%.
The ASCII repeat measures 1.127×/1.236×, with identical-baseline controls at
0.964×/1.090×. The regression persists beyond the observed control variation,
so the change is reverted. Combining printing measures 1.011×/1.019× and
emoji printing 0.991×/0.990×. All 313 VT tests and 57 benchmark checks pass;
source, binaries, all four print comparisons and the control remain in
`target/packed-simplify/step30/`.

### Step 31 experiment: pass the validated location to ASCII batches (rejected)

Reusing width validation's cursor location in the ASCII batch writer does not
produce a qualifying gain: complete ASCII feed measures 0.994×/1.001×, plain
scrolling 0.998×/1.017×, styled scrolling 1.013×/1.016×, and scalar printing
1.025×/1.002×. The change is reverted. All 313 VT tests and 57 benchmark checks
pass. All four comparisons, source and binaries remain under
`target/packed-simplify/step31/`.

### Step 32 experiment: write reflow's known final row (rejected)

Using the last exposed row for reflow cell installation, spacer-tail copies
and row metadata reduces retained-history emoji reflow 4.6%/3.1%. Viewport
emoji reflow measures 0.980×/0.995×, retained combining reflow 0.986×/1.030×,
and the ASCII-printing guard 1.093×/0.993×. No case reaches 5% in both orders,
so the change is reverted. All 313 VT tests and 57 benchmark checks pass.
The four comparisons and frozen candidate are in `target/packed-simplify/step32/`.

### Step 33 experiment: validate cursor resources on the appended page (rejected)

Reporting the cursor-resource match from the resolved append page avoids a
second lookup during final synchronization. Emoji printing improves only
2.7%/2.2%, emoji feed 1.7%/0.5%, and combining feed 0.1%/2.2%; no case qualifies.
The ASCII-printing guard measures 1.126×/1.001×. The change is reverted. All
314 VT tests and 57 benchmark checks pass, including public cursor style/link
edits and detached snapshots on both screens. Frozen source and measurements
remain in `target/packed-simplify/step33/`.


### Step 34 experiment: combine two width-preserving grapheme appends (not retained)

Fresh matched emoji-feed profiles show 511/5,048 Rust samples in text copying,
with host allocation/free work also prominent; the native profile has no
comparable host allocator cost. A bounded pair path retains both native
admission calls but allocates only the final immutable text. Pairs fall back
when the second admission could allocate or either scalar changes width.

Emoji feed improves 29.4% in both orders (33.317 → 23.543 µs), reaching 1.35×
the adjacent Ghostty measurement. Emoji scrolling improves 24.7%/25.4%.
However, ASCII printing measures 1.118×/1.058× and repeats at 1.007×/1.225×;
identical-baseline controls are 0.992×/1.093×. Combining feed repeats at
1.025×/1.034× with controls 0.992×/1.000×. This version is not retained.
All 315 VT tests and 57 benchmark checks pass, including allocation and
scalar/batched checks around native chunk boundaries, maximum cluster length,
wrapping, both screens and detached text. The measured candidate and all
samples remain in `target/packed-simplify/step34/`; the matched profiles are in
`step26c/feed-profiles/`. This is a useful lead, but the guard regressions must
be resolved before shipping it.


### Step 35: index glyph anchors directly during frame preparation

The supplied full-screen scrolling trace (`Rustty-scrolling.trace`, run
`stop-scroll-stop`, 12.197 seconds) contains 3,368 one-millisecond CPU samples.
The main thread accounts for 2,628 samples; `Renderer::prepare_once` appears
in 1,374 stacks. Hashing the temporary glyph-anchor map and growing that map
account for 432 distinct stacks, all under preparation. PTY readers account
for only three samples. These are sampled stacks, not frame-latency or GPU
completion measurements. Exports and the reproducible summary are retained in
`target/packed-simplify/scrolling-trace/`. The installed executable's source
revision is not inferred from its trace.

Ghostty's `src/renderer/generic.zig` walks shaped cells using `shaper_cells_i`
and their stored cell coordinates. Rustty instead rebuilt a `HashMap<usize,
f32>` for every shaped run to anchor glyph positions. Source indices are
already dense, so a `Vec<Option<f32>>` removes hashing and repeated map growth.
It preserves the preference for an advancing glyph over preceding marks and
the first-glyph fallback for clusters containing only marks. A focused test
also checks wide cells, UTF-8 source offsets and unordered clusters.

Both sources come from clean archives of `20bf494e9`; only `prepare.rs`
differs. Rust 1.95.0 and native CPU flags are fixed. The ordinary probe uses
Menlo 13 pt, scale 1, 120×40 cells and 1200×850 pixels. The supplemental probe
uses the same font at scale 2 with 3456×2234 pixels, deriving a 215×71 grid
from the font metrics. Its temporary measurement source is identical in both
snapshots. Each case warms 50 frames and records 50 in each measurement order.
Preparation and feed/resize are timed and counted separately.

A shared Cargo target initially reused local artifacts across extracted
source directories: the first application and supplemental probes had
identical before/after binary hashes. Those datasets are explicitly marked
invalid comparisons and retained as identical-binary observations. Cleaning
all local Rustty packages before each snapshot build fixes this. The clean
build reproduces both original standard-probe hashes exactly, confirming
that the standard preparation comparison already used the intended binaries.
All final supplemental and application comparisons use distinct verified
hashes; third-party dependency artifacts remain reusable.

The application replay fixes Menlo 13 pt, a 1200×850 physical window, scale 2
and a 74×24 terminal. It uses disposable signed bundles, a sleeping PTY and
50 warmup/50 measured frames per order. Frame CPU includes egui composition,
accessibility, GPU preparation, encoding and submission. GPU completion and
visible presentation are unmeasured. The replay deliberately pauses at least
50 ms between frames, so its intervals are not typing latency or maximum FPS.

| mixed_unicode | 2.830 → 2.352 | 3.185 → 2.655 | 0.841× / 0.791× | 6.3 → 5.6 | 120.7 → 116.7 |
| alternate_repaint | 2.432 → 2.267 | 3.052 → 2.533 | 1.273× / 0.871× | 5.7 → 6.3 | 120.6 → 120.6 |
| resize_reflow | 1.785 → 1.912 | 3.049 → 2.725 | 0.798× / 1.376× | 12.0 → 13.1 | 125.2 → 121.2 |

Ordinary scrolling, styled scrolling and mixed Unicode improve in both orders.
Application alternate repaint initially flags in one order; its repeat is
0.824×/0.819×. Resize/reflow remains variable: the initial CPU ratios are
0.798×/1.376×, the repeat is 1.269×/0.972×, and its identical-baseline control
was 0.997×/1.735×. Its p95 improves in both comparisons. The direction of the
median slowdown does not repeat, but these samples do not establish 3%
equivalence or an application resize speedup. All original samples are retained.
Measured median frame intervals are about 52–58 ms under the replay's imposed
pause; raw p95/p99 intervals, frame CPU/wall time, process CPU and RSS are
preserved in the reports.

Preparation improves in both orders across all twelve standard/scale-2 cases.
Feed/resize allocation counts and requested bytes are unchanged. Standard
ASCII preparation requests 1,279,184 → 969,904 bytes/frame; its scale-2 case
requests fewer bytes and makes 1,506 → 1,080 allocation calls. The renderer
and font checks pass 32 tests. Full workspace validation passes 481 tests
with two opt-in platform tests ignored, plus workspace/all-target and formatting
checks. The measured renderer source matches the validated working source.
The core VT code is unchanged by this step. This establishes renderer and
application improvements; it is not an application performance ratio to Ghostty.
Artifacts are under `target/packed-simplify/step35/`.


### Step 36: submit terminal rectangles as GPU instances

The renderer previously expanded every rectangle into six 36-byte vertices on
the CPU. Ghostty instead draws text with a four-vertex instanced triangle strip
(`src/renderer/generic.zig`). Rustty now sends one 52-byte instance per rectangle;
the vertex shader selects the same corners, UVs and triangle diagonal.
Atlas order, alpha blending, coordinate validation and retained-frame behavior
are unchanged. This reduces geometry upload bytes from 216 to 52 per rectangle.

Clean source snapshots start at `0154bb4c7`; only the GPU renderer and its shader
differ. The verified stage-35 application is reused as the baseline. Local Cargo
packages are cleaned between snapshot builds, and executable hashes differ.
Rust 1.95.0 and native CPU flags are fixed. The temporary upload probe uses the
existing six frame workloads, Menlo 13 pt, 120×40 cells, and 1200×850 pixels.
It measures GPU preparation and Rust allocator requests separately from terminal
feed and CPU text preparation; submission and completion waits occur outside
that interval. Every case has 50 warmup frames and 50 samples in each order.

| Workload | GPU prepare median µs, before → after | p95 µs, before → after | Forward / reverse | Rust allocation bytes/frame, before → after |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| cached_redraw | 58.0 → 24.6 | 65.3 → 31.0 | 0.435× / 0.416× | 430,524 → 104,164 |
| scroll_ascii | 67.4 → 27.1 | 77.8 → 32.6 | 0.393× / 0.409× | 531,612 → 128,500 |
| scroll_styled | 58.2 → 25.3 | 68.7 → 29.9 | 0.441× / 0.437× | 430,524 → 104,164 |
| mixed_unicode | 56.1 → 25.1 | 68.8 → 30.1 | 0.437× / 0.446× | 430,524 → 104,164 |
| alternate_repaint | 57.7 → 25.3 | 67.1 → 31.7 | 0.438× / 0.438× | 430,524 → 104,164 |
| resize_reflow | 60.6 → 26.6 | 69.6 → 33.3 | 0.447× / 0.435× | 430,524 → 104,164 |

GPU preparation improves by 55–61% in both orders across all six cases. The
number of measured Rust allocation calls stays at five per upload; the large
rectangle allocation shrinks. These counts exclude native driver allocations.

The application comparison uses the same stage-35 replay settings: scale 2,
74×24 cells, 1200×850 pixels, a sleeping PTY, and at least 50 ms between frames.
Frame CPU includes preparation, encoding and submission. GPU completion and
visible presentation are not measured.

| Application workload | Frame CPU median ms, before → after | p95 ms, before → after | Forward / reverse | Process CPU %, before → after | Median RSS MiB, before → after |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| cached_redraw | 0.972 → 0.904 | 1.727 → 1.264 | 0.983× / 0.812× | 3.3 → 2.9 | 115.5 → 115.3 |
| scroll_ascii | 1.779 → 1.739 | 2.635 → 2.435 | 0.897× / 1.052× | 4.7 → 4.7 | 113.7 → 112.7 |
| scroll_styled | 1.666 → 1.862 | 2.653 → 2.617 | 1.016× / 1.218× | 4.2 → 4.9 | 113.7 → 112.8 |
| mixed_unicode | 1.728 → 1.620 | 2.471 → 2.381 | 1.011× / 0.914× | 4.8 → 4.3 | 115.9 → 115.8 |
| alternate_repaint | 1.699 → 1.465 | 2.500 → 2.342 | 0.624× / 0.915× | 4.7 → 3.9 | 117.2 → 115.5 |
| resize_reflow | 1.073 → 1.498 | 1.986 → 1.903 | 1.402× / 1.275× | 7.7 → 9.7 | 121.3 → 121.1 |

The initial application ASCII and styled-scrolling comparisons flag one order.
Their repeats improve in both orders: ASCII 0.949×/0.796×, styled
0.863×/0.992×, with lower pooled p95 CPU time. Mixed Unicode and alternate
repaint do not exceed the 3% median flag in either initial order.

Resize/reflow remains noisy. Initial CPU ratios are 1.402×/1.275×; the first
repeat is 1.220×/0.590×. An identical-baseline control is 0.999×/1.129×, and the
adjacent second repeat is 0.936×/1.061×. That last comparison has essentially
unchanged pooled median CPU time (1.396 → 1.394 ms) and lower p95
(1.863 → 1.791 ms). These data do not establish 3% equivalence or a resize
speedup. The repeatable gain is GPU preparation; full application timing must
not be presented as a uniform percentage improvement. All samples, including
the flags and controls, are retained. A competing `codex-tui` build interrupted
the first resize repeat; the guard discarded that unfinished comparison and
reran it after the compiler exited.

The Metal pixel test verifies alpha, color, fractional tiled-glyph coverage,
and returning to an earlier atlas batch after skipping an empty rectangle.
The disposable native smoke passes retained GPU content, synchronized output,
resizing, both screens and idle scheduling (one settling redraw). Its first
candidate attempt timed out waiting for test-shell input; the unchanged
baseline and repeated candidate both pass. CPU frame timing measures encoding
and submission, not GPU completion or visible presentation. Raw medians,
p95/p99, frame intervals, process CPU and RSS are in the application reports.
Full workspace validation passes 481 tests, with 2 opt-in platform tests
ignored; workspace/all-target and formatting checks also pass. Feed and CPU
preparation allocation counts and bytes match in every upload-probe sample.
The validated source matches the frozen candidate. Artifacts are under
`target/packed-simplify/step36/`.

#### Supplied static-looking Codex trace

`static-looking-codex-15%-cpu.trace` spans 9.560 seconds and contains 1,327
one-millisecond CPU samples: approximately 13.9% of one core. Main-thread work
accounts for 1,107 samples; drawing appears in 946, terminal frame preparation
in 568, accessibility text construction in 61, and GPU preparation in 48.
PTY readers account for six samples. About 99% of samples run on efficiency
cores. Grouping drawing samples separated by more than 20 ms produces 91
bursts with a median start interval of 102 ms. These are sampled bursts, not
instrumented frame counts or presentation timestamps.

The user confirmed Codex was working even though its pane looked static. The
trace does not record redraw-request events, so it cannot prove which update
triggered each burst. It does show repeated full terminal preparation, including
203 samples in glyph-anchor hashing/map growth already removed by step 35.
A small status update is expensive because Rustty invalidates preparation for
the whole pane on a terminal generation change. Ghostty's `rebuildCells` in
`src/renderer/generic.zig` skips clean rows, and its shaper run iterator trims
trailing empty cells. Those are concrete remaining differences to investigate.
The recorded executable's source revision is unknown; this trace does not
measure the newer optimizations. Exports, sample stacks and analysis are under
`target/packed-simplify/static-trace/`.

### Step 37: stop shaping empty row tails

Ghostty's `src/font/shaper/run.zig` trims trailing empty cells before constructing
shaping runs. Rustty previously converted those cells to spaces, built source
and anchor arrays, and looked up their glyphs on every prepared frame. Seven
production lines now limit text preparation to the last nonzero packed cell.
The raw-bit check conservatively retains styles, backgrounds and wide spacers.
Backgrounds, selections, decorations and cursors still visit the full row.

Clean snapshots start at `9c596d6f3`; only `prepare.rs` differs. Both receive the
same seventh workload, `status_update`, which changes one cell in a populated
Unicode pane. It represents small visible updates during active work, rather
than an idle application. All probes use Rust 1.95.0, native CPU flags, Menlo
13 pt, 50 warmup frames and 50 samples in each measurement order. Local Cargo
packages are cleaned between snapshot builds; source and binary hashes are
recorded. The preparation probe always prepares a frame, including its
`cached_redraw` case; the application's corresponding case reuses a whole frame.

At the standard 120×40-cell, 1200×850-pixel size:

| Workload | Prepare median µs, before → after | p95 µs, before → after | Forward / reverse | Rust allocations/frame, before → after |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| cached_redraw | 228.8 → 171.2 | 256.7 → 172.4 | 0.748× / 0.758× | 572 → 482 |
| status_update | 226.8 → 171.0 | 243.8 → 175.7 | 0.745× / 0.767× | 572 → 482 |
| scroll_ascii | 224.8 → 178.6 | 241.9 → 203.5 | 0.812× / 0.764× | 534 → 522 |
| scroll_styled | 228.4 → 146.2 | 255.9 → 158.9 | 0.648× / 0.634× | 1,477 → 997 |
| mixed_unicode | 224.3 → 171.4 | 246.0 → 191.3 | 0.762× / 0.785× | 572 → 482 |
| alternate_repaint | 225.2 → 170.8 | 231.5 → 173.3 | 0.757× / 0.765× | 572 → 482 |
| resize_reflow | 216.5 → 171.1 | 238.2 → 186.3 | 0.767× / 0.840× | 572 → 482 |

At scale 2, 3456×2234 pixels and 215×71 cells:

| Workload | Prepare median µs, before → after | p95 µs, before → after | Forward / reverse | Rust allocations/frame, before → after |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| cached_redraw | 670.8 → 398.4 | 717.9 → 412.1 | 0.598× / 0.590× | 1,079 → 855 |
| status_update | 656.4 → 399.8 | 706.5 → 418.0 | 0.598× / 0.617× | 1,079 → 855 |
| scroll_ascii | 660.4 → 421.6 | 706.5 → 472.2 | 0.683× / 0.640× | 1,080 → 926 |
| scroll_styled | 665.2 → 348.1 | 727.9 → 368.8 | 0.515× / 0.526× | 2,768 → 1,774 |
| mixed_unicode | 671.5 → 400.1 | 703.5 → 405.2 | 0.592× / 0.602× | 1,079 → 855 |
| alternate_repaint | 663.2 → 399.1 | 721.8 → 428.8 | 0.595× / 0.605× | 1,079 → 855 |
| resize_reflow | 632.7 → 396.0 | 671.2 → 422.3 | 0.634× / 0.607× | 1,079 → 855 |

Preparation improves 16–37% at standard size and 32–49% at Retina size in both
orders. Retina status updates request 1,190,944 rather than 1,731,056 Rust heap
bytes per frame; styled scrolling requests 1,442,888 rather than 2,157,160.
Feed allocation counts and requested bytes match exactly in every paired sample
at both sizes. Native font/driver allocations are outside these allocator counts.

The application replay retains the earlier settings: 1200×850 pixels, scale 2,
74×24 cells, a sleeping PTY and a minimum 50 ms pause. Frame CPU covers host
preparation and GPU command submission, excluding GPU completion and visible
presentation. These ordinary-scheduling results remain much noisier:

| Workload | Frame CPU median ms, before → after | p95 ms, before → after | Forward / reverse | Process CPU %, before → after | Median RSS MiB, before → after |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| cached_redraw | 0.877 → 0.711 | 2.035 → 1.138 | 0.779× / 0.906× | 3.5 → 2.7 | 113.0 → 110.7 |
| status_update | 1.749 → 1.889 | 2.447 → 2.394 | 1.031× / 1.128× | 4.4 → 5.0 | 116.1 → 116.0 |
| scroll_ascii | 1.673 → 1.840 | 2.636 → 2.615 | 1.298× / 0.604× | 5.5 → 5.5 | 114.1 → 112.7 |
| scroll_styled | 2.060 → 1.874 | 2.523 → 2.392 | 0.923× / 0.888× | 5.1 → 4.8 | 113.9 → 113.1 |
| mixed_unicode | 1.908 → 1.887 | 2.396 → 2.408 | 1.101× / 0.939× | 4.9 → 4.9 | 115.7 → 115.9 |
| alternate_repaint | 1.859 → 1.793 | 2.341 → 2.192 | 0.905× / 1.004× | 5.2 → 5.0 | 116.4 → 116.4 |
| resize_reflow | 1.410 → 1.593 | 1.878 → 2.511 | 1.357× / 0.975× | 10.7 → 12.3 | 120.6 → 120.7 |

Fresh Instruments profiles of both status-update replays find 98 drawing
samples in the approximate measured baseline interval, all on efficiency cores,
and 82 in the candidate, eight on performance cores. Preparation appears in
27 versus 17 samples. Their profiled CPU medians are 2.085 versus 1.775 ms.
This establishes different core placement as a confound, not a controlled
speedup: only one profiled order was recorded, and profiling affects execution.

A diagnostic run used `/usr/sbin/taskpolicy -b` for both frozen applications.
Even cached redraws, which bypass the changed code, varied 1.128×/1.426×
(0.883 → 1.096 ms pooled CPU median). Background policy therefore did not
establish stable application timing. The guard detected an independent Cargo
build during the following case; that incomplete case was discarded and the
diagnostic stopped. Its first launch attempt used a nonexistent tool path and
produced no measurements. Production scheduling is unchanged.

The accepted gain is preparation time and allocation reduction. The application
data do not establish a general speedup or 3% equivalence; status updates and
resize remain unresolved. All initial results, profiles and diagnostic samples
are retained, including unfavorable measurements and p99/frame-interval data.

The regression test compares sparse rows with explicit space padding for Latin
ligatures, combining marks, wide cells, Arabic, Hebrew, mixed direction and emoji,
including cursor and selection geometry. All 482 workspace tests pass, with
two opt-in platform tests ignored; workspace/all-target and formatting checks
pass. Native smoke passes on repeat, including retained content, resize,
synchronized output and idle scheduling. The first candidate and unchanged
baseline both exceeded the smoke redraw limit with focus/pointer events; the
test was not weakened. Validated source matches the frozen candidate. Artifacts
are in `target/packed-simplify/step37/`.


### Step 38: execute the differential runner in Rust

The preserved Python driver spends most of its profiled comparison time in
recursive `difference` calls, constructing diagnostic paths even when every
field agrees. The 72-case inherited stream sample records 8,761,216 calls to
that function and 4.994 of 7.526 instrumented seconds there. These profiling
times identify the cost; the unprofiled timings below measure the improvement.

The Rust runner owns process transport, bounded requests/responses, deadlines,
delivery variants, strict comparison, snapshot cross-decoding and uninterrupted
state checks, coverage, replay, artifacts and minimization. Equality checks
avoid diagnostic-path construction for matching subtrees. The transport deadline
also covers a blocked input pipe. Failure directories retain previous evidence.
It uses existing dependencies and keeps the terminal implementations in separate
processes.

The generators remain available for offline regeneration. Their 21,844 base
fixtures occupy 4.8 MiB of compressed data, including the extra thorough-only
search cases. Every preserved request and coverage label was compared with the
original pre-rewrite collector. Source checksums, corpus membership and native
reference queries are checked when loading a group. Python-compatible MT19937
keeps arbitrary `--seed`/`--generated` runs available in Rust. `parity.py` is now
an exec launcher; `parity_reference.py` retains the original execution logic
for offline verification.

Both runners use the same frozen Ghostty and Rustty oracle executables. Each
case has 50 adjacent pairs per order, then the order is reversed. Completed
pairs survive pauses; a pair overlapping a detected Cargo, Clippy or profiling
job is discarded and retried. The table pools the 100 samples per runner and
uses the nearest-rank p95. These measurements isolate runner overhead.

| Suite | Python median / p95 (ms) | Rust median / p95 (ms) | Rust / Python, forward / reverse | Peak RSS, Python → Rust (MiB) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Smoke (148 comparisons) | 388.3 / 406.0 | 270.8 / 285.1 | 0.705× / 0.696× | 31.1 → 11.1 |
| Inherited stream-initial corpus (72) | 3563.9 / 3645.3 | 2056.7 / 2128.4 | 0.576× / 0.578× | 79.0 → 87.2 |
| Snapshot CSI continuations (51) | 955.8 / 966.0 | 645.4 / 650.2 | 0.675× / 0.676× | 32.9 → 12.0 |

All three cases improve in both orders. The corpus case uses about 8 MiB more
peak RSS; smoke and snapshot continuations use about 20 MiB less. RSS is the
median of the peaks reported by `wait4`; simultaneous aggregate memory across
the runner and both oracle processes was not sampled. The broader snapshot
pilot is retained separately and excluded from these timing results.

The configured suite passes **61,587 comparisons with zero mismatches** in
576.45 seconds, including all snapshot groups and native resource cases.
`--thorough` remains a separate, incomplete coverage gate. The timing wrapper
could not read `kern.clockrate` in the sandbox and returned an error after the
successful runner result; its additional resource statistics are unavailable.
The earlier interrupted step-37 suite is not counted as a completed run.

Validation also passes 494 workspace tests (two opt-in tests ignored), all-target
workspace checks, formatting, 12 Rust harness tests, and the 10 preserved Python
reference tests. The compatibility launcher passes from outside the checkout.
The harness tests cover strict number/boolean distinctions, nested metadata,
missing fields, malformed-byte delivery, live-versus-restored state, rejection
expectations, stale or truncated fixtures, deadlines, child cleanup, coverage,
external artifacts and minimization's original mismatch category/attempt bound.

This change leaves the VT and parser sources identical to `20bf494e9`; the
latest core/Ghostty ratios are those documented at step 26 until a new complete
comparison is recorded. Frozen runners, original source, fixture verification,
all accepted and interrupted timing data, and `validation.json` are retained
under `target/parity-driver/`.

### Step 39: reuse the empty-tail boundary for painting

The step-37 boundary now limits color resolution and decoration work as well
as shaping. A raw-zero cell has none of those attributes. Cursor and selection
rows retain the full painting range; styled empty cells remain inside the
boundary. The existing scan moves to the caller instead of adding another
scan or cache.

The candidate is built from a clean `c4720d2a8` source snapshot with only
`prepare.rs` changed. The verified step-37 baseline has identical renderer,
font, VT and parser sources. Both use the same seven workloads, Rust 1.95.0,
native CPU flags, Menlo 13 pt, 50 warmup frames and 50 samples in each order.
Builds, tests and profiling are excluded from these measurements.

At 120×40 cells and 1200×850 pixels:

| Workload | Prepare median µs, before → after | p95 µs, before → after | Forward / reverse | Rust allocations/frame, before → after |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| cached_redraw | 173.6 → 143.8 | 185.3 → 152.7 | 0.836× / 0.817× | 482 → 481 |
| status_update | 175.4 → 146.4 | 192.3 → 147.2 | 0.850× / 0.818× | 482 → 481 |

| mixed_unicode | 172.3 → 144.0 | 184.5 → 150.0 | 0.815× / 0.846× | 482 → 481 |
| alternate_repaint | 170.9 → 148.1 | 178.0 → 149.5 | 0.859× / 0.870× | 482 → 481 |
| resize_reflow | 167.8 → 145.8 | 174.2 → 151.0 | 0.875× / 0.866× | 482 → 481 |

At scale 2, 215×71 cells and 3456×2234 pixels:

| Workload | Prepare median µs, before → after | p95 µs, before → after | Forward / reverse | Rust allocations/frame, before → after |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| cached_redraw | 403.1 → 265.5 | 416.2 → 271.3 | 0.649× / 0.652× | 855 → 854 |
| status_update | 396.0 → 258.6 | 403.8 → 261.2 | 0.648× / 0.653× | 855 → 854 |
| scroll_ascii | 417.4 → 283.2 | 436.8 → 294.5 | 0.677× / 0.654× | 926 → 925 |
| scroll_styled | 348.7 → 174.3 | 352.6 → 178.5 | 0.501× / 0.500× | 1,774 → 1,773 |
| mixed_unicode | 398.7 → 259.8 | 413.8 → 266.6 | 0.646× / 0.655× | 855 → 854 |
| alternate_repaint | 401.2 → 260.0 | 418.8 → 262.2 | 0.649× / 0.648× | 855 → 854 |
| resize_reflow | 397.0 → 266.1 | 405.2 → 286.0 | 0.667× / 0.675× | 855 → 854 |

Every preparation case improves in both orders: 13–35% at standard size and
32–50% at Retina size. Retina status updates request 1,023,984 rather than
1,190,944 Rust heap bytes per frame; styled scrolling requests 1,240,088 rather
than 1,442,888. Feed allocation counts and requested bytes match in every paired
sample. Native font and driver allocations are outside these counts. These
are CPU preparation measurements; they do not measure GPU completion, visible
presentation or establish a new application-wide speedup.

The regression test compares exact geometry for sparse and space-filled rows,
including cursor focus/blink, selections in blank tails and erased colored
cells. All 495 workspace tests pass, with two opt-in platform tests ignored;
workspace/all-target checks and formatting pass. The disposable native smoke
passes Metal rendering, resizing, both screens, synchronized output and idle
scheduling with one settling redraw. It uses offscreen capture. The VT/parser
sources are unchanged, so the 61,587-comparison result at step 38 still applies.
Source and binary hashes, all samples and validation are retained under
`target/packed-simplify/step39/`.


### Core checkpoint after step 39

This is a fresh serial comparison of all 54 Rust workloads and 36 native
counterparts: 50 samples in each measurement order, 14,400 samples total.
The frozen step-19 and step-26c binaries run adjacently with the preserved
Ghostty executable. The current core and benchmark sources were verified
identical to `20bf494e9`; subsequent renderer and runner commits do not change
these kernels. Rust 1.95.0, native CPU flags and harness settings are fixed.
A detected independent Cargo build caused one unfinished scalar comparison
to be discarded and rerun. All retained comparisons passed the process guard. All original results and controls are retained under
`target/packed-simplify/core-checkpoint-39/`.

Times are pooled medians in microseconds. Lower ratios are faster. These
compare the current core with step 19, rather than attributing core changes
to the renderer work in step 39.

ASCII feed remains at parity with Ghostty. Ordinary ASCII and Chinese scrolling
are within 7–9%, styled ASCII scrolling is 19% slower, and text reading remains
32–45% slower for the non-combining corpora. Emoji overwrites remain the largest
complete-feed gap at 1.94×; direct emoji printing is 2.09×. Cloning, width lookup
and these reflow measurements match or beat the adjacent native measurements.
Native clone/reflow timings vary between checkpoints, so the newer ratios must
not be interpreted as improvements caused by the renderer. Chinese feed and
combining overwrites retain the previously documented native resource-admission
cliffs; their extreme ratios do not establish general Unicode superiority.

Only the short scalar scans exceed the 3% stage-regression flag. The following
controls also use 50 samples per direction. Each entry is forward / reverse;
identical controls launch the exact same executable under both labels.

| Scalar scan | Original current / step 19 | Repeat current / step 19 | Identical step-19 control | Identical current control |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| scalar/ascii | 1.127× / 1.184× | 1.181× / 0.979× | 1.184× / 0.871× | 1.072× / 0.854× |
| scalar/chinese | 1.285× / 0.921× | 1.098× / 1.247× | 1.172× / 0.985× | 1.089× / 1.078× |
| scalar/combining | 1.003× / 0.893× | 0.801× / 0.904× | 0.938× / 0.926× | 0.957× / 0.984× |
| scalar/emoji | 0.998× / 1.165× | 1.169× / 1.164× | 1.156× / 0.912× | 1.073× / 0.924× |

Scalar scans remain unresolved. Some adverse ratios repeat, while identical
binaries also vary by 7–18%. These data do not establish 3% equivalence or rule
out an underlying slowdown. The original full table is retained rather than
replaced with favorable repeat values. All other workloads stay within the
3% regression threshold in both initial directions. The stage-26 allocation
observations still apply to the unchanged core: all 14 observations match
step 19, including zero allocations for ordinary writes and row exposure
within capacity. Renderer allocation reductions are recorded separately above.


### Step 40: reuse exact sRGB channel conversions

A fresh six-second sample of the current Retina status-update workload finds
490 of 4,585 main-thread samples in `powf`; styled scrolling has 243 of 4,607.
Rustty repeatedly evaluates the same sRGB transfer function while preparing
colors. Ghostty's Metal renderer passes byte colors to `load_color` in
`src/renderer/shaders/shaders.metal`, where conversion happens on the GPU.
Rustty now initializes the existing function's 256 possible channel results
once in a 1 KiB `LazyLock` table. Its public linear-color representation and
blending behavior stay unchanged. This smaller fix precedes scratch-buffer reuse.

The clean candidate starts at `a17b8ebc9` and changes only `crates/rustty-render/src/lib.rs`.
The frozen step-39 baseline has identical inputs and dependencies. Measurements
use Rust 1.95.0, native CPU flags, Menlo 13 pt, 50 warmup frames and 50 samples
per direction, serially with process guards. Profiling and validation run
separately from timing.

At 120×40 cells and 1200×850 pixels:

| Workload | Prepare median µs, before → after | p95 µs, before → after | Forward / reverse |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |

| scroll_ascii | 159.2 → 141.8 | 175.1 → 143.7 | 0.823× / 0.893× |
| scroll_styled | 97.4 → 94.9 | 100.5 → 98.5 | 1.014× / 0.919× |
| mixed_unicode | 145.0 → 126.9 | 149.6 → 130.4 | 0.868× / 0.882× |
| alternate_repaint | 143.3 → 126.8 | 163.5 → 127.5 | 0.888× / 0.877× |
| resize_reflow | 145.1 → 128.4 | 148.6 → 132.7 | 0.888× / 0.882× |

At scale 2, 215×71 cells and 3456×2234 pixels:

| Workload | Prepare median µs, before → after | p95 µs, before → after | Forward / reverse |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| cached_redraw | 259.3 → 228.7 | 263.7 → 232.3 | 0.870× / 0.881× |
| status_update | 259.1 → 227.6 | 268.6 → 247.1 | 0.878× / 0.879× |
| scroll_ascii | 283.7 → 257.2 | 291.0 → 263.0 | 0.906× / 0.907× |
| scroll_styled | 176.3 → 160.9 | 178.3 → 166.4 | 0.927× / 0.919× |
| mixed_unicode | 258.4 → 229.9 | 259.6 → 258.5 | 0.949× / 0.879× |
| alternate_repaint | 259.8 → 225.8 | 284.9 → 228.7 | 0.847× / 0.887× |
| resize_reflow | 263.1 → 249.4 | 267.8 → 261.0 | 0.890× / 0.954× |


Most preparation medians improve by roughly 9–13%. Standard-size styled
scrolling is mixed, at 1.014×/0.919×; no workload exceeds a 3% median regression
in either order. Every feed and preparation allocation count and requested-byte
sample matches its baseline. The table adds static storage and initializes once;
it does not add a per-frame payload. These are preparation timings, not GPU
completion or visible-presentation measurements.

All 256 channel values match the original conversion. The 23 renderer tests
and 121 GPU/application/session tests pass, with two unrelated opt-in platform
tests ignored. Workspace/all-target checks and formatting pass. The core is
unchanged, so the complete Ghostty table and configured parity result above
remain applicable. The disposable offscreen Metal smoke passes resizing, both
screens, retained content and idle scheduling with one settling redraw. Frozen
source, binaries, profiles, samples and validation are under
`target/packed-simplify/step40/`.


### Step 41: reuse row and shaping scratch

Ghostty's CoreText `RunState.reset` retains its buffer capacity between runs.
Rustty instead allocated paint, text, source-offset and glyph-anchor buffers
for each row or shaping run, including cache hits. These four buffers now
live for one preparation call and are cleared between rows/runs. Shaping
borrows the text and owns a cache key only on a miss. No cross-frame state
or public interface is added. Exact geometry checks cover scratch reuse with
combining marks, wide cells and unordered glyph clusters.

The clean candidate starts at `3a3502175` and changes only `prepare.rs`.
The baseline binaries are the verified step-40 candidates. Both sizes use
Rust 1.95.0, native CPU flags, Menlo 13 pt, 50 warmup frames and 50 samples
in each order, serially without competing builds or profiles.

At 120×40 cells and 1200×850 pixels:

| Workload | Prepare median µs, before → after | p95 µs, before → after | Forward / reverse | Rust allocations/frame, before → after |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| cached_redraw | 124.2 → 108.2 | 131.6 → 115.0 | 0.872× / 0.868× | 481 → 25 |
| status_update | 123.9 → 106.1 | 130.9 → 112.8 | 0.855× / 0.860× | 481 → 25 |
| scroll_ascii | 139.8 → 119.6 | 150.4 → 126.0 | 0.864× / 0.844× | 521 → 27 |
| scroll_styled | 90.0 → 68.3 | 100.2 → 74.2 | 0.741× / 0.760× | 996 → 32 |
| mixed_unicode | 125.3 → 108.4 | 130.0 → 117.5 | 0.870× / 0.865× | 481 → 25 |
| alternate_repaint | 124.5 → 107.4 | 129.0 → 109.4 | 0.855× / 0.889× | 481 → 25 |
| resize_reflow | 128.3 → 111.1 | 132.5 → 116.4 | 0.861× / 0.873× | 481 → 25 |

At scale 2, 215×71 cells and 3456×2234 pixels:

| Workload | Prepare median µs, before → after | p95 µs, before → after | Forward / reverse | Rust allocations/frame, before → after |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| cached_redraw | 226.0 → 196.0 | 240.2 → 206.2 | 0.870× / 0.872× | 854 → 26 |
| status_update | 226.7 → 196.5 | 245.0 → 210.6 | 0.870× / 0.865× | 854 → 26 |
| scroll_ascii | 254.0 → 220.1 | 271.3 → 238.7 | 0.859× / 0.876× | 925 → 28 |
| scroll_styled | 163.0 → 124.1 | 174.9 → 137.3 | 0.756× / 0.780× | 1,773 → 34 |
| mixed_unicode | 226.0 → 198.1 | 242.0 → 206.1 | 0.885× / 0.866× | 854 → 26 |
| alternate_repaint | 226.7 → 195.8 | 252.5 → 212.3 | 0.866× / 0.851× | 854 → 26 |
| resize_reflow | 231.4 → 200.2 | 248.7 → 213.8 | 0.869× / 0.862× | 854 → 26 |

All preparation medians improve in both orders: 11–26% at standard size and
11–24% at Retina size. Every measured preparation allocation count and byte
request decreases; every feed allocation count and byte request matches its
paired baseline. Retina status updates request 758,472 rather than 1,023,984
Rust heap bytes per frame; styled scrolling requests 1,051,688 rather than
1,240,088. Native font/driver allocations are outside these counts. These
measure CPU preparation, not GPU completion or visible presentation.

All 23 renderer tests and 121 GPU/application/session tests pass, with two
opt-in platform tests ignored. Workspace/all-target checks and formatting pass.
The first offscreen native smoke failed its idle threshold with six redraws
amid focus/input events. Repeating the unchanged binary passes all checks,
including resizing, both screens, retained content and one settling idle
redraw. Both logs are retained. The unchanged core keeps the complete Ghostty
table and 61,587-comparison parity result above applicable. Frozen source,
binaries, samples and validation are in `target/packed-simplify/step41/`.


### Step 42: assign fallback glyph anchors during emission

Fresh six-second profiles of the committed renderer resolve the same binary
search from glyph byte offsets to terminal cells in both anchor passes and
quad emission. Ghostty applies cell offsets while emitting shaped cells in
its CoreText shaper. Rustty now assigns fallback anchors during emission,
deleting one pass and its repeated searches. The initial advancing-glyph pass
still handles marks that precede their base and unordered clusters. A regression
check also preserves anchors from glyphs with empty bitmaps.

The candidate changes only `prepare.rs` from `bfdd0530b`; baseline timings use
the frozen step-41 candidates. Measurements use the same seven cases, Menlo
13 pt, Rust 1.95.0, native CPU flags, 50 warmup frames and 50 samples in each
order, without competing builds or profiles. The separate profiling build adds
line tables; timing binaries use the normal release settings.

At 120×40 cells and 1200×850 pixels:

| Workload | Prepare median µs, before → after | p95 µs, before → after | Forward / reverse |

| resize_reflow | 199.6 → 180.6 | 208.0 → 201.3 | 0.902× / 0.915× |

All preparation cases improve in both directions: 8–15% at standard size
and 4–14% at Retina size. Every preparation and feed allocation count and byte
request matches its paired baseline. These are CPU preparation measurements;
GPU completion and visible presentation are not measured.

All 23 renderer tests and 121 GPU/application/session tests pass, with two
opt-in platform tests ignored. Workspace/all-target checks and formatting pass.
Native smoke attempts pass rendering, resizing, both screens and synchronized
output, but the complete scheduling check is inconclusive: the candidate and
the previously validated step-41 binary exceed the hidden-title redraw guard
while recording focus/occlusion events. Another candidate attempt stalls while
inactive; launching through macOS also encounters the redraw guard. All logs
are retained, rather than reporting the full smoke as passed. Core sources
remain unchanged, so the complete Ghostty table and configured parity result
still apply. Frozen source, binaries, profiles, samples and validation are under
`target/packed-simplify/step42/`.


### Application checkpoint after step 42

This fresh comparison measures the aggregate effect of steps 39–42, from
`c4720d2a8` to `c4b833085`. Only the renderer's `lib.rs` and `prepare.rs`
change between the frozen production sources. Application, GPU renderer,
fonts, core, dependencies and workloads match; the independent pane-Find
change is excluded. Source archives and executable hashes were verified.
Rust 1.95.0, native CPU flags, Menlo 13 pt, 50 warmup frames and 50 samples
per direction are fixed. Preparation and application runs are serial and
separate, with the existing build/profile process guard.

At 120×40 cells and 1200×850 pixels:

Preparation improves 41–55% at standard size and 54–67% at Retina size in
both orders. These are directly measured aggregate gains, not multiplied
stage ratios. Retina status updates request 758,472 rather than 1,190,944
Rust heap bytes per frame; styled scrolling requests 1,051,688 rather than
1,442,888. Every paired feed allocation count and requested-byte sample
matches. Native font and driver allocations are outside these counts.

The disposable application replay uses scale 2, a 1200×850 pixel target
and 74×24 cells, with offscreen Metal submission. Its frame CPU results are
mixed despite the preparation gains:

The following resources belong to those same application samples. Process

Status updates and mixed Unicode were repeated, followed by controls running
the exact same current executable under both labels. Each again has 50
samples per direction. These are frame CPU median ratios, forward / reverse:

| Workload | Original after / before | Repeat after / before | Identical-current control |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| cached_redraw | 0.693× / 0.627× | — | 0.543× / 0.686× |
| status_update | 1.013× / 2.027× | 0.904× / 2.291× | 0.453× / 1.812× |
| mixed_unicode | 1.091× / 1.057× | 1.134× / 1.077× | 1.201× / 1.002× |

Application effects remain unresolved. The adverse mixed-Unicode medians
repeat in both orders, and status updates remain adverse in one order.
Identical binaries also vary substantially, including a false apparent
cached-redraw improvement. These controls neither erase the original results
nor establish 3% equivalence. No application-wide speedup is claimed. Recorded
focus/occlusion traffic is a measurement concern; CPU frequency and core
placement have not been established as causes.

The replay inserts a minimum 50 ms pause, so its frame intervals do not
measure maximum throughput or typing latency. Frame wall and thread CPU
times cover CPU preparation/submission; GPU completion and visible
presentation are not measured. All wall-time statistics, tails, allocation
observations and 5,200 samples, including controls, are retained under
`target/packed-simplify/app-checkpoint-42/`. The step-42 native scheduling
smoke remains inconclusive as documented above. Core sources are unchanged,
so the complete Ghostty comparison and configured parity result still apply.


### Step 43: use one sprite membership match

The step-42 profiles attribute 227/5,025 status-update samples and 184 styled
scrolling samples to sprite membership. Rustty combined separate legacy and
ordinary range matches for every character. One match now handles all ranges,
including the adjacent legacy ranges; the redundant helper is removed.
Ghostty caches codepoint-to-font resolution in `SharedGrid.getIndex`, so it
does not repeatedly resolve sprite membership on a cache hit. This change
reduces Rustty's existing lookup without adding another cache.

The frozen baseline is `c4b833085`; only the two sprite source files differ.
The independent application edits are excluded. Both sizes use Rust 1.95.0,
native CPU flags, Menlo 13 pt, 50 warmup frames and 50 samples per direction,
serially with the process guard. Because the improvement is small, all seven
cases were repeated at both sizes. Original medians and tails are retained
below, alongside the confirmation ratios.

| scroll_styled | 119.1 → 116.7 | 128.2 → 123.3 | 0.981× / 0.980× | 0.955× / 0.995× |

| alternate_repaint | 176.7 → 174.4 | 187.0 → 190.0 | 0.983× / 0.995× | 0.991× / 0.972× |
| resize_reflow | 179.4 → 175.8 | 190.2 → 183.6 | 0.985× / 0.977× | 0.986× / 0.996× |

This is a small gain, generally 1–3%, with several directions effectively
unchanged. The adverse standard ASCII-scrolling confirmation did not repeat:
a further pair gives 0.958×/1.008×, while the identical-baseline control gives
1.050×/1.010×. The initial styled-scrolling p95 increase also does not repeat
(70.8 → 64.7 µs). No median regression above 3% is confirmed; these data do
not establish uniform tail-latency improvement.

All 1,112,064 Unicode scalar values match the original membership function.
All 502 workspace tests pass, with two opt-in tests ignored, including native
sprite pixel comparisons, font overrides, renderer geometry, GPU and session
checks. Workspace/all-target checks and formatting pass. Every preparation
and feed allocation count and requested-byte sample is unchanged. The core
and application scheduling are unchanged; the Ghostty table still applies,
and application-wide performance remains unresolved. Source, binaries,
exhaustive check, all samples and validation are under
`target/packed-simplify/step43/`.


### Step 44: build one shared payload for a ZWJ pair

Ghostty's `Page.appendGrapheme` normally appends into spare page-chunk space.
Rustty's matched emoji-feed profile instead spends 511/5,048 samples copying
text, with additional allocation and release costs for each immutable payload.
Rustty now joins a ZWJ and its following scalar using one final `Arc<str>`,
while retaining both native admission operations in their original order.
The caller only tries this path for a ZWJ in grapheme mode, avoiding the broad
pair checks from the rejected step-34 experiment.

The pair must preserve an existing wide cell's width and fit within the
first admission's native chunk. Chunk boundaries, selectors, Latin-1 scalars,
partial rows and mismatched cursor resources retain scalar handling. The
first admission may still grow, split or fail; the second cannot require
another native allocation. Cursor state, REP's previous character, generation,
shared immutable text and detached-snapshot lifetimes are preserved.

This complete serial comparison measures all 54 Rust workloads and 36
Ghostty counterparts, with 50 samples in each order (14,400 samples). Rust
1.95.0, native CPU flags and the harness are unchanged. The before executable
is the frozen step-26c core: its production and benchmark sources still match
the core at `59210757e`. The candidate changes only the two core source files;
renderer and application changes cannot affect these headless measurements.
Independent build interruptions discard the unfinished workload and resume
through the existing process guard. No owned builds or profiles overlap.
The runner's `simd` label denotes the candidate; this change adds no SIMD.

Times below are pooled medians in microseconds. Lower ratios are faster.

Emoji feed improves 41.0%, from 33.138 to 19.548 µs, and is now 11.5%
behind the adjacent Ghostty measurement of 17.537 µs. Emoji scrolling improves
36.1%, styled emoji scrolling 27.5%, and their memory-capped counterparts
36.6% and 29.1%. Mixed whole-buffer and 4 KiB feeds/streams improve 10–13%;
seven-byte delivery remains roughly unchanged because fewer pairs arrive
together. The earlier focused comparison independently finds 0.586×/0.588×
for emoji feed.

Ordinary ASCII feed remains at parity with Ghostty. ASCII and Chinese
scrolling remain 9–10% slower, styled ASCII scrolling is 23% slower, and
non-combining text reads remain 32–46% slower. Direct emoji `print` calls
remain about twice as slow: this change batches input already available in
a complete feed. Native Chinese-feed and combining-overwrite resource cliffs
remain workload-specific and do not establish general Unicode superiority.

All six original flags were repeated, then measured with the exact same
baseline and candidate executables under both labels. These also have 50
samples per direction; none of the original results is replaced.

The scalar/combining slowdown reverses in the repeat, while identical binaries
vary by up to 27% in this check. The adverse ASCII-print repeat in the forward
order (1.109×) is matched by its identical-baseline control (1.112×); the
identical candidate also produces 1.082×/1.106×. The earlier focused ASCII
result was 1.068×/1.067×, its first repeat 1.032×/1.013×, and its earlier
identical controls 1.051×/1.007× and 0.915×/0.992×. These signals do not confirm
a regression beyond the observed control variability, but do not establish
3% equivalence for short scans or direct ASCII printing. Disassembly also
finds the same ordinary-print, cell-write and outer grapheme-append instruction
sequences apart from relocations and diagnostic addresses; it cannot exclude
layout or runtime effects. No complete-feed or scrolling regression above 3%
is observed in either direction.

The existing allocation probe now includes four ZWJ pressure cases. All 14
original observations match exactly. Each new case feeds the same 4,096
lines before and after:

| History policy | Heap allocations, before → after | Requested bytes, before → after |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| unlimited | 787,940 → 394,724 | 94,134,571 → 84,697,387 |
| zero history | 786,486 → 393,270 | 22,561,667 → 13,124,483 |
| 512 KiB | 787,979 → 394,763 | 94,221,595 → 84,784,411 |
| 2 MiB | 787,977 → 394,761 | 94,215,659 → 84,778,475 |

Each policy avoids exactly 393,216 host allocations and 9 MiB of requested
bytes. Across all 18 observations, native admission counts, rebuilds,
page-buffer allocations, retained rows, final live bytes and conservative
charges remain unchanged. No additional history eviction hides the savings.
Ordinary writes and row exposure remain allocation-free within capacity.

Validation passes 327 VT tests with each kernel configuration, 504 workspace
tests with two opt-in platform tests ignored, workspace/all-target checks,
x86_64 core checks, formatting and both benchmark self-checks. New regressions
cover both screens, one-row wrapping, native chunk boundaries, maximum cluster
length, fragmentation, full snapshots, accounting, generation overflow, one
allocation per pair and detached text. The configured differential suite
passes all 61,587 comparisons with zero failures; the separate `--thorough`
coverage gate remains incomplete. Application-wide timing and the native
scheduling smoke retain the limitations documented after step 42. Frozen
source, binaries, all original samples and controls, allocation observations
and validation are under `target/packed-simplify/step44/`.


### Step 45 experiment: use a bounded scratch string (not retained)

Fresh matched profiles of the step-44 core still show host allocation and
text copying in emoji printing and feed. The payload builders clear all
260 scratch bytes before writing their valid prefix. Replacing that array
and manual byte length with the existing `arrayvec::ArrayString` removes
the unchecked UTF-8 conversion and six net lines, including its direct
dependency declaration. Disassembly confirms that the scratch-buffer zero
stores disappear. The final payload remains an immutable `Arc<str>`.

The change does not produce a qualifying complete-workload gain. These
serial comparisons use Rust 1.95.0, native CPU flags and 50 samples in each
order against the committed step-44 executable:

| Workload | Median µs, before → after | Forward / reverse |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| print/ascii | 9.158 → 8.983 | 1.181× / 0.923× |
| print/combining | 28.987 → 29.055 | 0.997× / 1.008× |
| print/emoji | 29.662 → 30.154 | 1.016× / 1.016× |
| feed/ascii | 0.503 → 0.498 | 1.002× / 0.981× |
| feed/combining | 32.390 → 32.480 | 1.004× / 1.004× |
| feed/emoji | 19.367 → 19.141 | 0.986× / 0.991× |
| stream/combining | 444.249 → 437.744 | 0.988× / 0.982× |
| stream/emoji | 294.375 → 296.091 | 1.004× / 1.008× |
| stream_styled/emoji | 419.266 → 410.107 | 0.979× / 0.976× |
| chunked_feed_mixed/7_bytes | 82.910 → 81.928 | 0.990× / 0.986× |
| chunked_feed_mixed/4_KiB | 51.780 → 50.977 | 0.987× / 0.984× |

The largest gain is 2.1%/2.4% in styled emoji scrolling; emoji feed improves
0.9–1.4%, while direct emoji printing slows 1.6% in both orders. ASCII
printing remains variable. No complete feed/stream improves by 5% in both
orders, so the candidate is not retained and no broader timing sweep or
regression controls are needed for acceptance. All 327 VT tests and both
benchmark self-checks pass, including the existing maximum 260-byte cluster
and detached-snapshot checks. Formatting passes. The dependency declaration
and source changes are restored to step 44, whose complete Ghostty table and
validation remain current. Source, binaries, six matched profiles, assembly
and all 11 comparisons are under `target/packed-simplify/step45/`.


### Step 46 experiment: pass the validated location to ASCII writes (not retained)

Matched ordinary and styled ASCII scrolling profiles show repeated cursor
and page resolution around the fill loop. Ghostty's `printSliceFill` uses
its cursor's resident row and cell pointers. A small Rustty candidate passes
the row location already returned by width validation into `write_cursor_ascii`,
using the existing scalar writer's resource checks and refreshing after wraps.
It adds no persistent cache or resource-admission shortcut.

Rust 1.95.0, native CPU flags, serial process guards and 50 samples per
direction remain fixed. The committed step-44 core is the baseline.

| Workload | Median µs, before → after | Forward / reverse |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| print/ascii | 9.293 → 9.396 | 0.925× / 1.026× |
| feed/ascii | 0.496 → 0.496 | 0.997× / 1.001× |
| feed/combining | 32.537 → 32.532 | 1.005× / 0.997× |
| feed/emoji | 19.349 → 19.380 | 1.000× / 1.002× |
| stream/ascii | 6.267 → 6.263 | 0.983× / 1.004× |
| stream/chinese | 9.955 → 9.924 | 1.007× / 0.974× |
| stream_styled/ascii | 9.909 → 9.696 | 0.977× / 0.982× |
| chunked_feed_mixed/4_KiB | 51.118 → 50.993 | 1.001× / 0.995× |

Styled ASCII scrolling improves 1.8–2.3%, but the other feeds and streams
remain effectively unchanged. The candidate does not reach 5% in both orders
and is not retained. All 327 VT tests and both benchmark self-checks pass,
including a debug assertion validating the supplied location. Formatting
passes after correcting the function signature layout; no measurements use
the unformatted build. Both modified source files are restored to step 44.
The complete Ghostty table and validation above remain current. Frozen source,
binaries, four matched profiles, assembly and the eight comparisons are under
`target/packed-simplify/step46/`.


### Step 47: let LLVM widen ASCII stores

Matched scrolling profiles and disassembly identified a manual ASCII store
loop that constructed only two cells at a time, unpacking bytes through scalar
registers. Reusing the existing reference loop removes that duplicate store
implementation: two lines are added and twelve removed. With Rust 1.95.0 and
native ARM CPU flags, LLVM emits sixteen-cell NEON groups and smaller tails.
Packed cells, resource admission and the other explicit SIMD kernels are unchanged.

The baseline is the committed step-44 core, also used by the report-only steps
45 and 46. Frozen executables run serially with 50 samples per direction and
adjacent reversed-order confirmation. The table retains all 54 workloads;
36 have an adjacent Ghostty measurement. Ratios below one favor the new Rustty.

ASCII feed improves 15.8%, ordinary ASCII scrolling 6.6%, and styled ASCII
scrolling 4.3%. Their memory-capped scrolling counterparts improve 8.5% and
6.5%. The earlier focused run independently finds 0.831×/0.834× for ASCII feed
and 0.922×/0.911× for scrolling. No allocation or native admission is removed
to obtain these gains; all 18 instrumented allocation observations exactly
match step 44, including ordinary writes and row exposure within capacity.

In this full sweep, ASCII feed is 15.5% faster than Ghostty and ASCII scrolling
is within 1%. The focused native scrolling measurement was faster, leaving
Rustty 9% behind in that run; the two measurements do not establish universal
parity. Styled ASCII scrolling remains 19% slower, Chinese scrolling 10%
slower, emoji feed 14% slower, and ordinary text reads 31–46% slower. Direct
emoji printing remains about twice as slow. The native Chinese-feed and
combining-overwrite cliffs retain the workload-specific limitations described
above. Application timing remains separate from these core measurements.

All seven flags above 3% in either order were repeated, followed by identical
baseline and identical candidate controls, each with 50 samples per direction.
The original measurements remain in the full table and artifacts.

| Workload | Original after / before | Repeat after / before | Identical baseline | Identical candidate |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| width/emoji | 0.967× / 1.030× | 1.000× / 1.001× | 0.975× / 0.993× | 1.040× / 0.964× |
| print/ascii | 1.081× / 0.938× | 0.910× / 0.950× | 0.955× / 1.023× | 0.992× / 1.050× |
| print/emoji | 1.013× / 1.034× | 1.024× / 1.029× | 0.992× / 0.982× | 1.002× / 0.995× |
| scalar/ascii | 0.916× / 1.124× | 0.807× / 1.126× | 1.073× / 0.842× | 0.818× / 0.858× |
| scalar/chinese | 1.258× / 0.927× | 1.175× / 1.075× | 0.980× / 0.785× | 0.995× / 0.779× |
| scalar/emoji | 1.269× / 0.999× | 1.001× / 1.003× | 0.800× / 1.270× | 0.996× / 1.303× |
| chunked_stream_mixed/7_bytes | 1.036× / 1.010× | 0.999× / 1.010× | 0.999× / 1.003× | 1.001× / 1.006× |

The mixed seven-byte scrolling flag does not repeat (0.999×/1.010×), and its
identical controls stay within 1%. The direct emoji-print repeat is 2.4–2.9%
slower, below the 3% rejection threshold. Chinese scalar scanning is slower
in the repeat, but the exact same baseline and candidate executables vary by
21–22% on that scan; identical emoji scans vary by 27–30%. ASCII-print and
scalar-scan controls also remain variable. These checks do not confirm a
regression beyond the observed control variability, and do not establish 3%
equivalence for the short scalar scans or direct ASCII printing. The original
adverse results and both controls are retained rather than replaced.

Validation passes 327 VT tests per kernel configuration, 504 workspace tests
with two opt-in platform tests ignored, workspace/all-target checks, generic
x86_64 checks with both kernel configurations, formatting and both benchmark
self-checks. All 61,587 configured differential comparisons pass with zero
failures; the separate thorough coverage gate remains incomplete. Source,
binaries, all samples and controls, assembly, allocation observations and
validation are under `target/packed-simplify/step47/`. The interrupted timing
run resumed from complete workloads; the process guard also repeated a case
that overlapped an unrelated compiler. Application-wide timing and the native
scheduling smoke retain their previously documented limitations.


### Step 48 experiment: scan four destination cells (not retained)

Fresh matched profiles of step 47 still locate substantial work in the ASCII
fill path: 1,290 of 4,547 ordinary-scrolling self samples and 801 of 4,572
styled-scrolling samples are in `print_ascii`. Ghostty scans four destination
cells per reduction. A small Rustty candidate uses the existing `wide::u32x8`
to compare four cells instead of two, retaining the scalar tail and exact
first-mismatch behavior. It adds no unsafe code or dependency.

The candidate does not reach the 5% complete-feed/stream threshold. The frozen
Rust 1.95.0 binaries use native CPU flags and 50 samples in each direction.
The process guard waits for independent builds and repeats interrupted cases.

| Workload | Median µs, before → after | Forward / reverse |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| print/ascii | 9.116 → 9.953 | 1.075× / 1.101× |
| feed/ascii | 0.419 → 0.407 | 0.982× / 0.972× |
| stream/ascii | 5.830 → 5.725 | 0.989× / 0.975× |
| stream_styled/ascii | 9.502 → 9.370 | 0.995× / 0.979× |

ASCII feed improves only 1.8%/2.8%, ordinary scrolling 1.1%/2.5%, and styled
scrolling 0.5%/2.1%. Direct ASCII printing also flags a slowdown in both orders.
No candidate workload qualifies for acceptance, so no broader timing sweep or
regression controls are needed to reject it. All 327 VT tests, including the
existing bit-field, mismatch, alignment and tail equivalence checks, both
benchmark self-checks and formatting pass. The source change is restored to
step 47. Its full Ghostty table and validation remain current. Frozen source,
binaries, four matched profiles and all four comparisons are preserved under
`target/packed-simplify/step48/`.


### Step 49: reuse cursor preparation after scrolling

Matched profiles locate repeated cursor-resource checks in styled scrolling:
`sync_cursor_resources` accounts for 9.76% of the step-47 self samples, with
another 4.07% in `Color::eq`. Ghostty's index path returns after its row operation
prepares the cursor. Rustty's `shift_rows`, `scroll_up` and `index` instead repeat
resource synchronization and cursor clamping. Carrying the completed preparation
through those helpers removes the duplicate work without adding persistent state.
Generation increments, non-scrolling movement, one-row resets and horizontal
margins retain their previous behavior.

Hyperlinks keep the existing synchronization path. A public hyperlink without
an ID is re-admitted on each synchronization, consuming native string reservations.
The new regression verifies the original counts on a clean build of the committed
baseline, along with public pen edits, opaque link bytes, generation wraparound,
history and both screens. The earlier unguarded candidates are superseded and
remain preserved in `step49/` and `step49b/`.

The baseline is the committed step-47 core. Frozen Rust 1.95.0 executables use
native ARM CPU flags, 50 samples per direction and adjacent reversed-order
comparisons. All 54 workloads are retained below; 36 include Ghostty. Ratios
below one favor the new Rustty.

The full sweep finds ordinary ASCII scrolling 4.0% faster, styled ASCII
scrolling 5.7% faster, and their memory-capped counterparts 4.5% and 5.1% faster
using pooled medians. Ordinary Chinese scrolling improves 2.7%; styled Chinese
scrolling improves 2.3%, or 4.7% with the memory cap. The focused gains repeat,
but their magnitude varies:

| Workload | Focused forward / reverse | Full sweep | Confirmation |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| stream/ascii | 0.962× / 0.972× | 0.960× / 0.964× | — |
| stream/chinese | 0.970× / 0.966× | 0.976× / 0.953× | — |
| stream_styled/ascii | 0.946× / 0.933× | 0.951× / 0.931× | 0.957× / 0.971× |
| stream_styled/chinese | 0.949× / 0.945× | 0.969× / 0.972× | 0.991× / 0.985× |

Styled ASCII scrolling improves in all six measured orders, by 2.9–6.9%.
The first focused run clears 5% in both orders for both styled workloads;
the later full sweep and confirmation do not consistently sustain a 5% minimum.
The retained result is a modest, repeatable scrolling improvement. Complete feed
and mixed-delivery workloads otherwise remain close to the baseline.

In this sweep ordinary ASCII scrolling is 3.4% faster than Ghostty, while styled
ASCII scrolling remains 12.2% slower and Chinese scrolling 7.1% slower. Emoji
feed remains 11.8% slower, ordinary text reads about 30–46% slower, and direct
emoji printing about twice as slow. Focused native timings differ from the full
sweep, so these ratios do not establish universal parity. The native Chinese-feed
and combining-overwrite cliffs retain the workload-specific limitations above.

All eight cases flagged above 3% in either the focused or full run were repeated,
then measured with the exact same baseline under both labels and the exact same
candidate under both labels. Each control again has 50 samples per direction.

| Workload | Flagged run, forward / reverse | Repeat | Identical baseline | Identical candidate |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| scalar/ascii | 1.161× / 1.126× | 1.183× / 1.097× | 0.943× / 1.004× | 1.019× / 1.181× |
| scalar/chinese | 1.103× / 1.168× | 0.786× / 1.391× | 1.476× / 1.183× | 1.002× / 1.005× |
| scalar/emoji | 1.008× / 1.223× | 1.173× / 1.015× | 1.163× / 0.996× | 1.004× / 1.004× |

| reflow/chinese | 1.032× / 0.971× | 0.991× / 0.998× | 0.996× / 1.032× | 1.006× / 1.009× |
| chunked_stream_mixed/4_KiB | 1.054× / 1.000× | 0.991× / 0.998× | 0.989× / 0.998× | 0.984× / 0.994× |
| stream_styled_memory_capped/combining | 1.033× / 1.055× | 1.017× / 1.007× | 1.002× / 1.006× | 1.007× / 1.000× |
| print/ascii (focused) | 1.080× / 1.004× | 1.171× / 0.958× | 0.977× / 1.053× | 1.118× / 1.020× |

The reflow and mixed-stream flags do not repeat. Memory-capped combining scrolling
repeats at 1.017×/1.007×, with both identical controls within 1%. The larger scalar
and direct-ASCII-print variations remain unresolved: identical Chinese scalar
scans vary by 47.6%, identical candidate ASCII scans by 18.1%, and identical
candidate ASCII printing by 11.8%. The original adverse results remain in the
tables and artifacts. These controls do not establish 3% equivalence for scalar
scans or direct ASCII printing, and are not evidence of speedups in those cases.

All 18 instrumented allocation observations exactly match step 47, including
zero-allocation ordinary writes and row exposure within capacity. Native admission
counts, memory charges, retained history and page recycling are unchanged.
Validation passes 328 VT tests in each kernel configuration, 15 additional parser
tests with scalar kernels, 505 workspace tests with two opt-in platform tests
ignored, workspace/all-target checks, generic x86_64 checks in both kernel
configurations, formatting and both benchmark self-checks. All 61,587 configured
differential comparisons pass with zero failures; the separate thorough coverage
gate remains incomplete.

The process guard now also waits for nextest test processes. It preserved complete
comparisons through independent build waits. A failed stop check during the guard
update briefly allowed two owned runners to overlap; that entire first partial
sweep was quarantined and excluded before restarting serially. The first public-link
baseline check also reused stale shared debug output; its result was invalidated
and replaced by a clean baseline rebuild. Both discarded attempts remain recorded.
Frozen source, executables, all accepted samples and controls, assembly, allocation
observations and validation are under `target/packed-simplify/step49c/`.
Application-wide timing and the native scheduling smoke retain their previously
documented limitations.


### Step 50 experiment: reuse the scalar wide-store loop (not retained)

Matched Chinese-scrolling profiles put 373 of 5,037 Rustty self samples (7.4%)
in the handwritten wide-cell store. Its assembly loads codepoints into scalar
registers before constructing two-lane vectors. Reusing the existing scalar
loop removes 15 net source lines and lets LLVM load vectors directly, handling
16 codepoints per main-loop iteration. The generated code improves scrolling,
but the complete workloads do not meet the acceptance threshold.

Frozen Rust 1.95.0 binaries use native ARM flags, adjacent comparisons and 50
samples per direction. The guard waits automatically for independent builds.
One interrupted profile was excluded and both profiles were recaptured.

| Workload | Before µs | Candidate µs | Ghostty µs | Candidate / before, forward / reverse |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| feed/ascii | 0.418 | 0.432 | 0.506 | 1.052× / 1.020× |
| feed/chinese | 2.295 | 2.180 | 445.547 | 0.973× / 0.937× |
| stream/chinese | 9.860 | 9.532 | 9.497 | 0.970× / 0.967× |
| stream_styled/chinese | 13.456 | 13.169 | 37.015 | 0.977× / 0.981× |

Chinese scrolling improves 3.0–3.3%; Chinese feed improves 2.7%/6.3%.
No complete feed/stream workload improves at least 5% in both orders, so the
candidate is restored without a broader sweep. The ASCII-feed slowdown is
retained in the record; regression controls are unnecessary for this rejection.
All 328 VT tests, both benchmark self-checks and formatting pass. Sources,
frozen binaries, assembly, matched profiles and all 1,200 timing samples are
preserved in `target/packed-simplify/step50/`. The step-49 core, full Ghostty
table and validation remain current. The native Chinese-feed cliff retains
the workload-specific limitation described above.

### Step 51 experiments: simplify the temporary text layout (not retained)

Fresh matched ASCII/Chinese read profiles place 97.1–97.2% of Rustty samples
in the cell-text loop and 2.8% in row iteration. Ghostty's loop extracts scalar
values directly. Rustty's generated loop retains UTF-8 range checks from the
temporary `CellText` constructor, although the caller only requests characters.

Removing the cached byte length shrinks that temporary from 24 to 16 bytes,
but LLVM then retains more encoding work while packing the enum fields.
The two adjacent comparisons use frozen Rust 1.95.0 binaries, native ARM flags
and 50 samples per direction, with automatic waits for competing builds.

| Workload | Before µs | Candidate µs | Ghostty µs | Candidate / before, forward / reverse |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| read/ascii | 2.885 | 3.787 | 1.954 | 1.317× / 1.305× |
| read/chinese | 2.829 | 4.203 | 1.959 | 1.482× / 1.474× |

That candidate is rejected. Further code-generation probes try an explicit
enum tag, separate scalar storage, a flat adapter and an outlined encoder.
They retain unwanted checks or an encoding call in the scalar loop, so none
is retained or assigned a timing-based speedup. Each passes 328 VT tests and
both benchmark self-checks. Sources, binaries, assembly, matched profiles and
the 600 measured samples are preserved under `target/packed-simplify/step51/`
through `step51f/`. The original source is restored and formatting passes.
The step-49 core, full Ghostty table and validation remain current.
